It browses with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. If they wish, users can easily share tags anonymously through a public server. Everything is free, no ads, and privacy is the first concern. If you have 10,000+ files and cannot find anything, hydrus might help!</p> <p>Hydrus supports various filetypes for images, video and audio files, image project files, and more. A full list of supported filetypes is here. On the Windows and Linux builds, an MPV window is embedded to play video and audio smoothly. Some supported filetypes cannot be viewed directly in the client, such as PDF, but it is easy to launch any file with your OS's default program.</p> <p>I am continually working on the software and try to put out a new release every Wednesday by 8pm EST. Executable releases are available for Windows and Linux, but the program is in python, so you can also just run it straight from the source code in Windows, Linux, or macOS. I welcome feedback of any sort and will try to get back to any pings every Saturday.</p> <p>The client can download files and parse tags and other metadata from a number of websites, including the popular imageboards and boorus, and some gallery sites. It can be extended to download from more locations using easily shareable user-made downloaders. It can also be set to 'subscribe' to any gallery search, repeating it every few days to keep up with new results.</p> <p>The program's emphasis is on your freedom. You control everything, and the program never phones home. In the same way, it is quite an advanced program, and not a beautiful one, so it isn't for everyone.

(especially if I try to do something on the system that isn't hydrus)","text":"<p>The kernel launches a process called <code>kswapd</code> to swap and reclaim memory pages, after hydrus has used pages they need to be returned to the OS (unless fragmentation is preventing this).  The OS needs to scan for pages allocated to programs which are not in use, it doens't do this all the time because holding the required locks would have a serious performance impact.  The behaviour of <code>kswapd</code> is goverened by several important values.  If you are using a classic system with a reasonably sized amount of memoery and a swapfile you should tune these.  If you are using memory compression (or should be using memory compression because you have a cheap system) read this whole document for info specific to that configuration.</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>vm.watermark_scale_factor</code> This factor controls the aggressiveness of kswapd. It defines the amount of memory left in a node/system before kswapd is woken up and how much memory needs to be free before kswapd goes back to sleep. The unit is in fractions of 10,000. The default value of 10 means the distances between watermarks are 0.1% of the available memory in the node/system. The maximum value is 1000, or 10% of memory. A high rate of threads entering direct reclaim (allocstall) or kswapd going to sleep prematurely (kswapd_low_wmark_hit_quickly) can indicate that the number of free pages kswapd maintains for latency reasons is too small for the allocation bursts occurring in the system. This knob can then be used to tune kswapd aggressiveness accordingly.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>vm.watermark_boost_factor</code>: If memory fragmentation is high raise the scale factor to look for reclaimable/swappable pages more agressively.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I like to keep <code>watermark_scale_factor</code> at 70 (70/10,000)=0.7%, so kswapd will run until at least 0.7% of system memory has been reclaimed. i.e. If 32GiB (real and virt) of memory, it will try to keep at least 0.224 GiB immediately available.</p> <ul> <li><code>vm.dirty_ratio</code>: The absolute maximum number of un-synced memory(as a percentage of available memory) that the system will buffer before blocking writing processes.  This protects you against OOM, but does not keep your system responsive.</li> <li> <p>Note: A default installation of Ubuntu sets this way too high (60%) as it does not expect your workload to just be hammering possibly slow disks with written pages. Even with memory overcomitting this can make you OOM, because you will run out of real memory before the system pauses the program that is writing so hard.  A more reasonable value is 10 (10%)</p> </li> <li> <p><code>vm.dirty_background_ratio</code>: How many the number of unsynced pages that can exist before the system starts comitting them in the background.  If this is set too low the system will constantly spend cycles trying to write out dirty pages.  If it is set too high it will be way to lazy.  I like to set it to 8.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>vm.vfs_cache_pressure</code> The tendancy for the kernel to reclaim I/O cache for files and directories.  This is less important than the other values, but hydrus opens and closes lots of file handles so you may want to boost it a bit higher than default. Default=100, set to 110 to bias the kernel into reclaiming I/O pages over keeping them at a \"fair rate\" compared to other pages.  Hydrus tends to write a lot of files and then ignore them for a long time, so its a good idea to prefer freeing pages for infrequent I/O. Note: Increasing <code>vfs_cache_pressure</code> significantly beyond 100 may have negative performance impact. Reclaim code needs to take various locks to find freeable directory and inode objects. With <code>vfs_cache_pressure=1000</code>, it will look for ten times more freeable objects than there are.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fixing_Hydrus_Random_Crashes_Under_Linux.html#virtual_memory_under_linux_4_unleash_the_memory","title":"Virtual Memory Under Linux 4: Unleash the memory","text":"<p>An example <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> section for virtual memory settings.</p> <pre><code>########\n# virtual memory\n########\n\n#1 always overcommit, prevents the kernel from using a heuristic to decide that a process is bad for asking for a lot of memory at once and killing it.\n#https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting\nvm.overcommit_memory=1\n\n#force linux to reclaim pages if under a gigabyte \n#is available so large chunk allocates don't fire off the OOM killer\nvm.min_free_kbytes = 1153434\n\n#Start freeing up pages that have been written but which are in open files, after 2 hours.\n#Allows pages in long lived files to be reclaimed\nvm.dirtytime_expire_seconds = 7200\n\n#Have kswapd try to reclaim .7% = 70/10000 of pages before returning to sleep\n#This increases responsiveness by reclaiming a larger portion of pages in low memory condition\n#So that the next time you make a large allocation the kernel doesn't have to stall and look for pages to free immediately.\nvm.watermark_scale_factor=70\n\n#Have the kernel prefer to reclaim I/O pages at 110% of the rate at which it frees other pages.\n#Don't set this value much over 100 or the kernel will spend all its time reclaiming I/O pages\nvm.vfs_cache_pressure=110\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Fixing_Hydrus_Random_Crashes_Under_Linux.html#virtual_memory_under_linux_5_phenomenal_cosmic_power_itty_bitty_living_space","title":"Virtual Memory Under Linux 5: Phenomenal Cosmic Power; Itty bitty living space","text":"<p>Are you trying to run hydrus on a 200 dollar miniPC, this is suprisingly doable, but you will need to really understand what you are tuning.</p> <p>To start lets explain memory tiers.  As memory moves further away from the CPU it becomes slower.  Memory close to the CPU is volatile, which means if you remove power from it, it disappears forever.  Conversely disk is called non-volatile memory, or persistant storage.  We want to get files written to non-volatile storage, and we don't want to have to compete to read non-volatile storage, we would also prefer to not have to compete for writing, butthis is harder.</p> <p>The most straight forward way of doing this is to seperate where hydrus writes its SQLITE database(index) files, from where it writes the imported files.  But we can make a more flexible setup that will also keep our system responsive, we just need to make sure that the system writes to the fastest possible place first.  So let's illustrate the options.</p> <pre><code>  graph\n  direction LR\n  CPU--&gt;RAM;\n  RAM--&gt;ZRAM;\n  ZRAM--&gt;SSD;\n  SSD--&gt;HDD;\n  subgraph Non-Volatile\n      SSD;\n      HDD;\n  end</code></pre> <ol> <li>RAM: Information must be in RAM for it to be operated on</li> <li>ZRAM: A compressed area of RAM that cannot be directly accessed.  Like a zip file but in memory.  Or for the more technical, like a compressed ramdisk.</li> <li>SSD: Fast non-volatile storage,good for random access about 100-1000x slower than RAM.</li> <li>HDD: Slow non-volatile storage good for random access.  About 10000x slowee than RAM.</li> <li>Tape(Not shown): Slow archival storage or backup. surprisingly fast actually but can only be accessed sequentially.</li> </ol> <p>The objective is to make the most of our limited hardware so we definitely want to go through zram first.  Depending on your configuration you might have a bulk storage (NAS) downstream that you can write the files to, if all of your storage is in the same tower as you are running hydrus, then make sure the SQLITE .db files are on an SSD volume.</p> <p>Next you should enable ZRAM devices (Not to be confused with ZWAP). A ZRAM device is a compressed swapfile that lives in RAM.</p> <p>ZRAM can drastically improve performance, and RAM capacity. Experimentally, a 1.7GB partition usually shrinks to around 740MiB.  Depending on your system ZRAM may generate several partitions. The author asked for 4x2GB=8GIB partitions, hence the cited ratio.</p> <p>ZRAM must be created every boot as RAM-disks are lost when power is removed Install a zram generator as part of your startup process.  If you still do not have enough swap, you can still create a swapfile.  RAM can be configured to use a partition as fallback, but not a file.  However you can enable a standard swapfile as described in the prior section.  ZRAM generators usually create ZRAM partitions with the highest priority (lowest priority number) so ZRAM will fill up first, before normal disk swaping.</p> <p>To check your swap configuration <pre><code>swapon #no argument\ncat /proc/swapinfo\n</code></pre></p> <p>To make maximum use of your swap make sure to SET THE FOLLOWING VM SETTINGS</p> <pre><code>#disable IO clustering we are writing to memroy which is super fast\n#IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS YOUR SYSTEM WILL HITCH as it tries to lock multiple RAM pages.  This would be desirable on non-volatile storages but is actually bad on RAM.\nvm.page-cluster=0\n\n#Tell the system that it costs almost as much to swap as to write out dirty pages. But bias it very slightly to completing writes.  This is ideal since hydrus tends to hammer the system with writes, and we want to use ZRAM to eat spikes, but also want the system to slightly prefer writing dirty pages\nvm.swappiness=99\n</code></pre> <p>The above is good for most users.  If however you also need to speed up your storage due to a high number of applications on your network using it you may wish to install cache, provided you have at least one or two avialable SSD slots, and the writing pattern is many small random writes.</p> <p>You should never create a write cache without knowing what you are doing. You need two SSDs to crosscheck eachother, and ideally ressilant server SSDs with large capacitors that ensure all content is always written.  If you go with a commercial storage solution they will probably check this already, and give you a nice interface for just inserting and assigning SSD cache.</p> <p>You can also create a cach manually wit the Logical Volume using the LVM.  If you do this you can group together storage volumes.  In particular you can put a read or write cache with an SSD in front of slower HDD. </p>"},{"location":"PTR.html","title":"PTR for Dummies","text":"<p>or Myths and facts about the Public Tag Repository</p>"},{"location":"PTR.html#what_is_the_ptr","title":"What is the PTR?","text":"<p>Short for Public  Tag Repository, a now community managed repository of tags.

Try and keep the number of files manageable. If a janitor at any point is unsure if the petition is correct they are likely to deny the entire petition rather than risk losing good tags. Some users have pushed changes regarding hundreds of tags over thousands of files at once, but due to disregarding PTR tagging practices or being lazy with justification the petition has been denied entirely. Or they have just been plain wrong, trying to impose frankly stupid tagging methods.</p> <p>Furthermore, if you are two weeks out of sync with PTR you are unable to push additions or deletions until you're back within the threshold.</p> Q: Does this automagically tag my files? A: No. Until we get machine learning based auto-tagging nothing is truly automatic. All tags on the PTR were uploaded by another user, so if nobody uploaded tags associated with the hash of your file it won't have any tags in the PTR. Q: How good is the PTR at tagging [insert file format or thing from site here]? A: That depends largely on if there's a scrapable database of tags for whatever you're asking about. Anything that comes from a booru or site that supports tags is fairly likely to have something on the PTR. Original content on some obscure chan-style imageboard is less so. Q: Help! My files don't have any tags! What do!? A: As stated above, some things are just very likely to not have any tags. It is also possible that the files have been altered by whichever service you downloaded from. Imgur, Reddit, Discord, and many other sites and services recompress images to save space which might give it a different hash even if it looks indistinguishable from the original file. Use one of the IQDB lookup programs linked in Cuddle's wiki. Q: Why is my database so big!? This can't be right. A: It is working as intended. The size is because you are literally downloading and processing the entire tag database and history of the PTR. It is done this way to ensure redundancy and privacy. Redundancy because anybody with an up-to-date PTR sync can just start their own. Privacy because nobody can tell what files you have since you are downloading the tags for everything the PTR has. Q: Does that mean I can't do anything about the size? A: Correct. There are some plans to crunch the size through a few methods but there are a lot of other far more requested features being, well, requested. Speaking crassly if you are bothered by the size requirement of the PTR you probably don't have a big enough library to really benefit and would be better off just using the IQDB script."},{"location":"PTR.html#janitors","title":"Janitors","text":"<p>Janitors are the people that review petitions.

Tagging every little thing and detail is a sure path to burnout. If you are looking to petition removal of tags then it is preferable to sibling common misspellings, underscores, and defunct tags rather than deleting them outright. The exception is for ambiguous tags where it is better to delete and replace with a less ambiguous tag. When deleting tags that don't belong in the image it can be helpful if you include a short description as to why. It's also helpful if you sanitise downloaded tags from sites with tagged galleries before pushing them to the PTR. For example Pixiv, where you can have a gallery of multiple images, each containing one character, and all of the characters being tagged. Consequently all images in that gallery will have all of the character tags despite no image having more than one character.</p>"},{"location":"PTR.html#siblings_and_parents","title":"Siblings and parents","text":"<p>When making siblings, go for the closest less-bad tag. Example: <code>bad_tag</code> -&gt; <code>bad tag</code>, rather than going for what the top level sibling might be. This creates less potential future work in case standards change and makes it so your request is less likely to be denied by a janitor not being entirely certain that what you're asking is right. Be careful about creating siblings for potentially ambiguous tags. Is <code>james bond</code> supposed to be <code>character:james bond</code> or is it <code>series:james bond</code>? This is a bit of a bad example due to having the case of the character always belonging to the series, so you can safely sibling it to <code>series:james bond</code> since all instances of the character will also have the series, but not all instances of the series will have the character. So let us look at another example: how about <code>wool</code>? Is it the material harvested from sheep, or is it the Malaysian artist that likes to draw Touhou? In doubtful cases it's better to leave it as is, petition the tag for deletion if it's incorrect and add the correct tag.</p> <p>When making parents, make sure it's an always factually correct relationship. <code>character:james bond</code> always belongs to <code>series:james bond</code>.

In the normal operation of your system, files are constantly being partially transfered to disk, even if the OS pretends they have been fully written to disk.  This is called write cache and it is really important to use it or your system's performance would be terrible.  The caveat is that until you have \"<code>synced</code>\" the disk cache, the changes to files are not actually in permanent storage.

The database ensures that any partially written data is reversible to a known state (called a rollback).</p> <p>An existing file may be in 3 possible states:</p> <ul> <li>Unflushed: Contents is owned by the program writing the file, but control returns immediately to the program instead of waiting for a full write.  Content can be transitioned from unflushed to flushed using <code>fflush(FILE)</code>. <code>fflush()</code> is called automatically when a programmer closes a file, or exits the program normally(under most runtimes but not for example in Java).  If the program exits abnormally before data is flushed it will be lost when the program crashes.</li> <li>Flushed: Pending write to permenant storage but memory has been transfered to the operating system. Data will not be lost if the calling program crashes, since the OS promises it will \"eventually\" arrive on disk before returning from <code>fflush()</code>. When you \"safely shutdown:, you are instructing the OS among other things to sync the flushed files.  If someone decides to read a file before it has been synced the OS will read the contents up until the flush from the flush buffer, and return that instead of what is actually on disk.  If the OS crashes due to error or power failure, data that are flushed but not synced will be lost.</li> <li>Synced: Written to permenant storage. A programmer may request that the contents of the file be synced, or it is done gradually over time to free the OS buffers</li> </ul> <p>To ensure the consistency of the database and rollback when needed, the database engine keeps a journal of what it is doing.  Each transaction ends in a <code>flush</code> which may be followed by a <code>sync</code>. In <code>synchronous=2</code> there is a sync after EVERY <code>COMMIT</code>, for <code>synchronous=1</code> it depends on the journal mode, often enough to maintian consistanc, but not after every commit.  The flush ensures that everything written before the flush will occur before the line that indicates the transaction completed.  The sync ensures that the entire contents of the transaction has been written to permenant storage before proceeding. The OS is not obligated to write chunks of the database file in the order it recieves them.  It only guarantees that if you flush, everything submitted before the flush happens first, and everything submitted after the flush happens next.</p> <p>The sync is what is controlled by the <code>synchronous</code> switch.  Allowing the database to ignore whether sync actually completes is the magic that makes <code>synchronous=0</code> so dang fast.</p>"},{"location":"Understanding_Database_Synchronization.html#an_example_journal","title":"An example journal","text":"<ol> <li>Begin Transaction 1</li> <li>Write Change 1</li> <li>Write Change 2</li> <li>Read data</li> <li>Write Change 3</li> <li>End Transaction 1</li> </ol> <p>Each of these steps are performed in order.

This property of a database is called atomicity in the sense that something atomic is \"indivisible\"; either all of the steps in transaction 1 occur or non of them occur.</p> <p>Hydrus is structured in such a way that the database is written to to keep track of your file catalog only once the file has been fully imported and moved where it is supposed to be.  Thus every action hydrus takes is kept \"atomic\" or \"repeatable\" (redo existing work that was partway through).

As written we are actually glossing over a number of steps that happen in step 8. Actually the database must make a few syncs to be sure the database is reversible.

But what if We haven't even finished creating a rollback for the changes made in step 1 and step 2 starts partially changing the database file?  Then bam power failure.  We now can't revert the database because we don't have a complete rollback, but we also can't move forward in time either because we don't have a marker showing the completion of transaction 2.

We aren't at the point where it is the same as hiring a human artist to remaster a work, but the old assumptions are eroding. The idea of an 'original' being the better of any potential duplicate is still in some human, soulful way true, but perhaps in a decade many of us will be regularly upscaling and recolouring works with intelligent 'correction' models. For instance, imagine a model that could, at least for certain classes of image, reliably undo rough jpeg artifacts or subsampling.</p> <p>Some people hate this idea, others love it. Again, these questions are subjective. If you are someone who is keen to interpolate your video to 60 or 120fps or enhance your legacy sRGB jpegs to HDR JpegXLs, the fundamental principle of 'copy = additive entropy' may no longer hold quite as strong. Maybe we are heading towards a world of 'copy = asymptote towards model average'. This is a tricky problem that this auto-resolution system is not specifically designed to answer. We'll see how it all shakes out.</p> <p>Whatever happens, we'll want to keep all true originals, or confidently lossless copies, just to be safe.</p>"},{"location":"advanced_duplicates_auto_resolution.html#duplicates_auto-resolution","title":"duplicates auto-resolution","text":"<p>We will now look at the Duplicates Auto-Resolution system. It works using 'rules' that each describe a pair search to run, a test to assert and arrange the pair into AB, and then an action to apply ('A is better than B'). Let's start with a simple and generally non-controversial example: pixel-duplicate jpeg &amp; png pairs.</p> <p>When converting an image, if you save a jpeg, the output file will usually have some small new 'fuzzy' artifacts, but if you save a png, it is always pixel perfect to the original. This is one of the reasons why jpegs of rich images tend to be smaller than pngs--jpegs are a lossy simulation and compress well, pngs are a lossless copy and so bloat up to account for everything perfectly.</p> <p>Thus, when you have a normal (i.e. not some weird edge case like a 1x1 image) potential duplicate pair that is pixel-duplicates (i.e. they have exactly the same pixel image content) where one is a jpeg and the other a png, you know, for certain, that the png is a derivative copy of the jpeg. The lossless pixel-perfect copy was made from the lossy original. This happens most often when someone is posting from one application to another, or with a phone, where rather than uploading the source jpeg, they do 'copy image' and paste that into the upload box--the browser eats the clipboard bitmap and creates the accursed 'Clipboard.png', and this eventually percolates to our clients as duplicate spam.</p> <p>In this case, we always want to keep the (usually smaller, original) jpeg and ditch the (bloated, derived) png. This violates our earlier idea that larger files tend to be better, but since the file formats are different, we can ignore it for this comparison. The important thing is we know the pixel-perfect jpegs are always a 'more original' version of the image than the png.</p> <p>In the normal manual duplicates filter, this would be:</p> <ul> <li>A two-part duplicates search, for 'system:filetype is jpeg' and 'system:filetype is png', with 'must be pixel dupes'.</li> <li>Arranging each incoming pair as 'the jpeg is A, the png is B'</li> <li>Sending the duplicate action of 'set A as better than B, and delete B'.</li> </ul> <p>We could follow this script every time and be happy with it. Let's do it!</p> <p>Duplicates are one-in-a-million tricky, but do not worry too much about it</p> <p>There are ways of copying jpegs while maintaining exactly the same pixel data, so we don't actually know the png is a direct copy of that jpeg file you are looking at. If the original file is a jpeg A, perhaps you have a jpeg B (A stripped of header metadata) and a png C (A copied to clipboard).</p> <p>It doesn't really matter. Imagining unusual scenarios is interesting to think about, but it doesn't get much work done. We'll always hit some edge cases, and better to have jpeg data stored in the jpeg format. If we ever encounter A, we'll try to recognise it has more full header metadata and perform A&gt;B, which achieves the originally desired A&gt;C by transitivity.</p>"},{"location":"advanced_duplicates_auto_resolution.html#auto-resolution_tab","title":"auto-resolution tab","text":"<p>Go to the duplicates filtering page and switch to the 'auto-resolution' tab.

When a file is imported, it is added to 'hydrus local file storage' and 'combined local file domains' and one or more local file domains. When it is deleted from all of its local file domains, it is taken from the 'combined local file domains' umbrella and moved to trash. When trashed files time out or are force-delete-confirmed by the user, the files are removed from 'trash' and then 'hydrus local file storage' and will soon be physically deleted from your hard disk (although, by default, hydrus tries to send to your OS recycle bin, so there's usually another chance to save something that was accidentally deleted).</p>"},{"location":"advanced_multiple_local_file_services.html#advanced","title":"more advanced usage","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Careful! It is easy to construct a massively overcomplicated Mind Palace here that won't actually help you due to the weight of overhead. If you want to categorise things, tags are generally better. But if you do want strict search separations for speed, workflow, or privacy, try this out. </p> <p>If you put your files through several layers of processing, such as <code>inbox/archive-&gt;tags-&gt;rating</code>, it might be helpful to create different file domains for each step. I have seen a couple of proposals like this that I think make sense:</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n  A[inbox] --&gt; B[sfw processing]\n  A --&gt; C[nsfw processing]\n  B --&gt; D[sfw archive]\n  C --&gt; E[nsfw archive]</code></pre> <p>Where the idea would be to make the 'is this sfw/nsfw?' choice early, probably at the same time as archive/delete, and splitting files off to either side before doing tagging and rating. I expect to expand the 'archive/delete' filter to support more actions soon to help make these workflows easy.</p> <p>File Import Options allows you to specify which service it will import to. You can even import to multiple, although that is probably a bit much. If your inbox filters are overwhelming you--or each other--you might like to have more than one 'landing zone' for your files:</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n  A[subscription and gallery inbox] --&gt; B[archive]\n  B --- C[sfw]\n  D[watcher inbox] --&gt; B\n  E[hard drive inbox] --&gt; B\n  F[that zip of cool architecture photos] --&gt; C</code></pre> <p>Some users have floated the idea of storing your archive on one drive and the inbox on another. This makes a lot of sense for network storage situations--the new inbox could be on a local disk, but the less-accessed archive on cheap network storage. File domains would be a great way to manage this in future, turning the workflow into nice storage commands.</p> <p>Another likely use of this in future is in the Client API, when sharing with others. If you were to put the files you wanted to share in a file domain, and the Client API were set up to search just on that domain, this would guarantee great privacy.

By default, the Client API is HTTP, which means it is ok for communication on the same computer or across your home network (e.g. your computer's web browser talking to your computer's hydrus), but not secure for transmission across the internet (e.g. your phone to your home computer). You can turn on HTTPS, but due to technical complexities it will give itself a self-signed 'certificate', so the security is good but imperfect, and whatever is talking to it (e.g. your web browser looking at https://127.0.0.1:45869) may need to add an exception.</p> <p>The Client API is still experimental and sometimes not user friendly. If you want to talk to your home computer across the internet, you will need some networking experience. You'll need a static IP or reverse proxy service or dynamic domain solution like no-ip.org so your device can locate it, and potentially port-forwarding on your router to expose the port. If you have a way of hosting a domain and have a signed certificate (e.g. from Let's Encrypt), you can overwrite the client.crt and client.key files in your 'db' directory and HTTPS hydrus should host with those.</p> <p>Once the API is running, go to its entry in services-&gt;review services. Each external program trying to access the API will need its own access key, which is the familiar 64-character hexadecimal used in many places in hydrus. You can enter the details manually from the review services panel and then copy/paste the key to your external program, or the program may have the ability to request its own access while a mini-dialog launched from the review services panel waits to catch the request.</p>"},{"location":"client_api.html#tools_created_by_hydrus_users","title":"Tools created by hydrus users","text":""},{"location":"client_api.html#browser_add-on","title":"Browser Add-on","text":"<ul> <li>Hydrus Companion: A Chrome/Firefox extension for hydrus that allows easy download queueing as you browse and advanced login support.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"client_api.html#client_browsing","title":"Client Browsing","text":"<ul> <li>Hydrus Web: A web client for hydrus with an advanced but also phone-friendly interface.</li> <li>Hydrui (Repo): A web client for hydrus with an interface similar to the regular client.</li> <li>hyAway (Repo): A web client for hydrus, including browsing your current session.

It doesn't store any of your settings--it just knows how to present a database as a nice application. If you just run the hydrus_client executable straight, it looks in its 'db' subdirectory for a database, and if one is not found, it creates a new one. If it sees a database running at a lower version than itself, it will update the database before booting it.</p> <p>It doesn't really matter where you put this. An SSD will load it marginally quicker the first time, but you probably won't notice. If you run it without command-line parameters, it will try to write to its own directory (to create the initial database), so if you mean to run it like that, it should not be in a protected place like Program Files.</p> <p>If you run from source, things are basically the same, but you are building a virtual environment in the <code>venv</code> folder and launching hydrus_client.py from the activated venv instead. Note: a venv includes absolute path links, so you will have to rebuild your venv every time you move your install directory!</p> </li> <li> <p>the actual SQLite database</p> <p>The client stores all of your settings and its current knowledge about files--like file size and resolution, tags, ratings, inbox status, and so on and on--in a handful of SQLite database files, defaulting to install_dir/db. Everything you have ever set is in here. Depending on the amount of metadata your client is tracking, these files might total 1MB or upwards of 100GB.</p> <p>In order to perform a search or to fetch or process tags, the client has to interact with these files in many small bursts, which means it is best if these files are on a drive with low latency. An SSD is ideal, but a regularly-defragged HDD with a reasonable amount of free space also works well.</p> </li> <li> <p>your media files</p> <p>All of your actual jpegs and webms and so on (and their thumbnails) are stored in a single complicated directory that is by default at install_dir/db/client_files. All the files are named by their hash and stored in efficient hash-based subdirectories. In general, it is not navigable by humans, but it works very well for the fast access from a giant pool of files the client needs to do to manage your media.</p> <p>Thumbnails tend to be fetched dozens at a time, and very randomly, so it is, again, ideal if they are stored on an SSD. Your regular media files--which on many clients total hundreds of GB--are usually fetched one at a time for human consumption and do not benefit from the expensive low-latency of an SSD. They are best stored on a cheap HDD, and, if desired, also work well across a network file system.</p> <p>There are 256 file folders, named using the hexadecimal prefix of the files they store, from f00 to fff, and 256 thumbnail folders, from t00 to tff. Thus you should expect to have 512 folders total. Depending on an advanced setting called granularity, each of those may also have 16 subfolders, from 0-f.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"database_migration.html#different_drives","title":"these components can be put on different drives","text":"<p>Although an initial install will keep these parts together, it is possible to, say, run the SQLite database on a fast drive but keep your media in cheap slow storage.

It is not very technically difficult, but I do not recommend it for new users.</p> <p>Backing such an arrangement up is obviously more complicated, and the internal client backup is not sophisticated enough to capture everything, so I recommend you figure out a broader solution with a third-party backup program like FreeFileSync.</p>"},{"location":"database_migration.html#pulling_media_apart","title":"pulling your media apart","text":"<p>Danger</p> <p>As always, I recommend creating a backup before you try any of this, just in case it goes wrong.</p> <p>If you would like to move your files and thumbnails to new locations, hit database-&gt;move media files, giving you this dialog:</p> <p></p> <p>The buttons let you add more locations and remove old ones. The operations on this dialog are simple and atomic--at no point is your db ever invalid.</p> <p>Beneath db? means that the path is beneath the main db dir and so is stored internally as a relative path. Portable paths will still function if the database changes location between boots (for instance, if you run the client from a USB drive and it mounts under a different location).</p> <p>Weight means the relative amount of media you would like to store in that location. It only matters if you are spreading your files across multiple locations. If location A has a weight of 1 and B has a weight of 2, A will get approximately one third of your files and B will get approximately two thirds.</p> <p>Max Size means the max total size of files the client will want to store in that location. Again, it only matters if you are spreading your files across multiple locations, but it is a simple way to ensure you don't go over a particular smaller hard drive's size. One location must always be limitless. This is not precise, so give it some padding. When one location is maxed out, the remaining locations will distribute the remainder of the files according to their respective weights. For the meantime, this will not update by itself. If you import many files, the location may go over its limit and you will have to revisit 'move media files' to rebalance your files again. Bear with me--I will fix this soon with the background migrate. </p> <p>Let's set up an example move:</p> <p></p> <p>I made several changes:</p> <ul> <li>Added <code>C:\\hydrus_files</code> to store files.</li> <li>Added <code>D:\\hydrus_files</code> to store files, with a max size of 128MB.</li> <li>Set <code>C:\\hydrus_thumbs</code> as the location to store thumbnails.</li> <li>Removed the original <code>C:\\Hydrus Network\\db\\client_files</code> location.</li> </ul> <p>While the ideal usage has changed significantly, note that the current usage remains the same. Nothing moves until you click 'move files now'. Moving files will take some time to finish. Once done, it looks like this:</p> <p></p> <p>The current and ideal usages line up, and the defunct <code>C:\\Hydrus Network\\db\\client_files</code> location, which no longer stores anything, is removed from the list.</p> <p>Missing Locations</p> <p>If any of the 512 file/thumbnail media folders are not where the client expects them to be on program boot, a repair dialog appears to let you update the record. This is not impossible to figure out, and in some situations doing this on purpose can be faster than letting the client migrate things itself. I generally do not recommend moving folders around while the client is not up, but if you are feeling confident, go for it. You made a backup, right? :^)</p> <p>Note that you cannot boot a client until it has located all the file subfolders.</p> <p>Also, if your folders are in the 'wrong' locations but all those locations are known to the client, you will not get the repair dialog--it'll just give you a popup and shuffle its internal knowledge around.</p>"},{"location":"database_migration.html#granularity","title":"granularity","text":"<p>ADVANCED, STILL IN TESTING, BE CAREFUL</p> <p>To start with, the hydrus database stores its files in a two-hex 'granularity'.

(i.e. on a different computer's hard drive) The SQLite database is sensitive to interruption and requires good file locking, which network interfaces often fake.

It may work ok to start, but when the SQLite database grows to large size, this can cause extreme access latency. I have been told that BTRFS works well these days, and they have been working specifically to improve SQLite performance, but keep it in mind if you are using anything else. Using NTFS compression mode on the database files is not a good idea. Compressing a hydrus database backup is fine, but the live db is sensitive.</p> <p>Rather than typing the path out in a terminal every time you want to launch your external database, create a new shortcut with the argument in.

If your OS suddenly changes, your absolute <code>D:\\hydrus_files</code> is going to be seen as a relative path by Linux and you'll end up with like <code>/home/you/hydrus/db/D:\\hydrus_files</code>. There's no huge worry here--hydrus won't rush to break anything, and the worst case is generally it just freaking out that the thing doesn't exist. You just need to tell it the correct new path.</p> <p>Before any system migration, make sure you:</p> <ul> <li>finish any hard drive import pages that were working</li> <li>pause your import folders</li> <li>pause your export folders</li> <li>MAKE A BACKUP</li> </ul> <p>Install a fresh new hydrus on the new machine and then, using a network share or a USB drive, copy the database folder, files, and thumbnails from the old to the new. You can insert the db directly into your new <code>install_dir/db</code> folder, or if you want to set up a new <code>--db_dir</code>, put the db in that location and set up the new shortcut.</p> source installs <p>If the type of OS hasn't changed, you can sometimes get away with copying a built install folder around. If you run from source, however, you must recreate a new source install folder with that OS's <code>git</code> and then build a new venv (then obviously migrate your original db dir as needed). Do not try to migrate an entire source installation folder!</p> macOS App <p>If you are moving to or from the macOS App, recall that the App cannot store the hydrus db inside it, so the correct 'default' location (i.e. without <code>--db_dir</code>), analogous to <code>install_dir/db</code> on other installs, is <code>~/Library/Hydrus</code>. You can always go <code>file-&gt;open-&gt;database directory</code> on any running client to find out where it is currently running from.</p> <p>Boot up your newly assembled client, and if your files or thumbnails are stored outside of <code>install_folder/db/client_files</code>, there's a good chance it will complain about them being missing. Don't panic! Just tell the repair dialog the correct new locations, and it'll stitch itself back together.</p> <p>Then:</p> <ul> <li>check <code>options-&gt;external programs</code> and update anything as needed</li> <li>check <code>options-&gt;exporting</code> and update the default export directory</li> <li>check a file's <code>right-click-&gt;share-&gt;export files</code> window to see what the default export path there is</li> <li>check <code>database-&gt;move media files</code> and remove any empty stubs from the old system</li> <li>edit your import folders to point at the correct locations</li> <li>edit your export folders to point at the correct locations</li> <li>unpause import/export folders</li> </ul> <p>Then you should be good! If it all went wrong, revert to your backup and let me know, and I'll help you figure it out.</p>"},{"location":"database_migration.html#multiple_clients","title":"p.s. running multiple clients","text":"<p>Since you now know how to tell the software about an external database, you can, if you like, run multiple clients from the same install (and if you previously had multiple install folders, now you can now just use the one).

POST requests and 200 OK responses are generally going to be a JSON 'Object' with variable names as keys and values obviously as values. There are examples throughout this document. For GET requests, everything is in standard GET parameters, but some variables are complicated and will need to be JSON-encoded and then URL-encoded. An example would be the 'tags' parameter on GET /get_files/search_files, which is a list of strings.

Remote services like the PTR have a queue of pending changes waiting to be committed by the user to the server, so in these cases I will expose to you the full suite of 'pend x'/'petition x'/'rescind pend x'/'rescind petition x'. Although you might somewhere be able to 'pend'/'petition' content to a local service, these 'pending' changes will be committed instantly so they are synonymous with add/delete.</p> <ul> <li>When an 'add' is committed, the data is removed from the deleted record and added to the current record.</li> <li>When a 'delete' is committed, the data is removed from the current record and added to the deleted record.</li> <li>When a 'pend' is committed, the data is removed from the deleted record and added to the current record. (It is also deleted from the pending record!)</li> <li>When a 'petition' is committed, the data is removed from the current record and added to the deleted record. (It is also deleted from the petitioned record!)</li> <li>When a 'rescind pend' is committed, the data is removed from the pending record.</li> <li>When a 'rescind petition' is committed, the data is removed from the petitioned record.</li> </ul> <p>Let's look at where the verbs make sense. Again, horizontal, so 'Content that is Current can receive a Petition command':</p> Add/Pend Delete/Petition Rescind Pend Rescind Petition No state May May - - Current - May - - Deleted May - - - Pending May overwrite an existing reason - May - Petitioned - May overwrite an existing reason - May <p>In hydrus, anything in the content update pipeline that doesn't make sense, here a '-', tends to result in an errorless no-op, so you might not care to do too much filtering on your end of things if you don't need to--don't worry about deleting something twice.</p> <p>Note that content that does not yet exist can be pre-emptively petitioned/deleted. A couple of advanced cases enjoy this capability, for instance when you are syncing delete records from one client to another.</p> <p>Also, it is often the case that content that is recorded as deleted is more difficult to re-add/re-pend. You might need to be a janitor to re-pend something, or, for this API, set some <code>override_previously_deleted_mappings</code> parameter. This is by design and helps you to stop automatically re-adding something that the user spent slow human time deciding to delete.</p>"},{"location":"developer_api.html#access_management","title":"Access Management","text":""},{"location":"developer_api.html#api_version","title":"GET <code>/api_version</code>","text":"<p>Gets the current API version.

The data given here is not guaranteed to be useful for editing siblings and parents on a particular service. That data, which is currently pair-based, will appear in a different API request in future.</li> <li>This is what is actually processed, right now, for those user preferences, as per tags-&gt;sibling/parent sync-&gt;review current sync. It reflects what they currently see in the UI. If the user still has pending sync work, this computation will change in future, perhaps radically (e.g. if they just removed the whole PTR ruleset two minutes ago), as will the rest of the \"display\" domain. The results may be funky while a user is in the midst of syncing, but these values are fine for most purposes. In the short term, you can broadly assume that the rules here very closely align with what you see in a recent file metadata call that pulls storage vs display mappings. If you want to decorate an autocomplete results call with sibling or parent data, this data is good for that.</li> </ol> <ul> <li><code>ideal_tag</code> is how the tag appears in normal display to the user.</li> <li><code>siblings</code> is every tag that will show as the <code>ideal_tag</code>, including the <code>ideal_tag</code> itself.</li> <li><code>descendants</code> is every child (and recursive grandchild, great-grandchild...) that implies the <code>ideal_tag</code>.</li> <li><code>ancestors</code> is every parent (and recursive grandparent, great-grandparent...) that our tag implies.</li> </ul> <p>Every descendant and ancestor is an <code>ideal_tag</code> itself that may have its own siblings.</p> <p>Most situations are simple, but remember that siblings and parents in hydrus can get complex. If you want to display this data, I recommend you plan to support simple service-specific workflows, and add hooks to recognise conflicts and other difficulty and, when that happens, abandon ship (send the user back to Hydrus proper). Also, if you show summaries of the data anywhere, make sure you add a 'and 22 more...' overflow mechanism to your menus, since if you hit up 'azur lane' or 'pokemon', you are going to get hundreds of children.</p> <p>I generally warn you off computing sibling and parent mappings or counts yourself. The data from this request is best used for sibling and parent decorators on individual tags in a 'manage tags' presentation. The code that actually computes what siblings and parents look like in the 'display' context can be a pain at times, and I've already done it. Just run /search_tags or /file_metadata again after any changes you make and you'll get updated values.</p>"},{"location":"developer_api.html#add_tags_search_tags","title":"GET <code>/add_tags/search_tags</code>","text":"<p>Search the client for tags.</p> Restricted access: YES.

If you send a normal list of tags here, a default reason of \"Petitioned from API\" will be given. If you want to set your own reason, you can instead give a list of [ tag, reason ] pairs.</p> Some example requests: Adding some tags to a file<pre><code>{\n  \"hash\" : \"df2a7b286d21329fc496e3aa8b8a08b67bb1747ca32749acb3f5d544cbfc0f56\",\n  \"service_keys_to_tags\" : {\n    \"6c6f63616c2074616773\" : [\"character:supergirl\", \"rating:safe\"]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> Adding more tags to two files<pre><code>{\n  \"hashes\" : [\n    \"df2a7b286d21329fc496e3aa8b8a08b67bb1747ca32749acb3f5d544cbfc0f56\",\n    \"f2b022214e711e9a11e2fcec71bfd524f10f0be40c250737a7861a5ddd3faebf\"\n  ],\n  \"service_keys_to_tags\" : {\n    \"6c6f63616c2074616773\" : [\"process this\"],\n    \"ccb0cf2f9e92c2eb5bd40986f72a339ef9497014a5fb8ce4cea6d6c9837877d9\" : [\"creator:dandon fuga\"]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> A complicated transaction with all possible actions<pre><code>{\n  \"hash\" : \"df2a7b286d21329fc496e3aa8b8a08b67bb1747ca32749acb3f5d544cbfc0f56\",\n  \"service_keys_to_actions_to_tags\" : {\n    \"6c6f63616c2074616773\" : {\n      \"0\" : [\"character:supergirl\", \"rating:safe\"],\n      \"1\" : [\"character:superman\"]\n    },\n    \"aa0424b501237041dab0308c02c35454d377eebd74cfbc5b9d7b3e16cc2193e9\" : {\n      \"2\" : [\"character:supergirl\", \"rating:safe\"],\n      \"3\" : [\"filename:image.jpg\"],\n      \"4\" : [[\"creator:danban faga\", \"typo\"], [\"character:super_girl\", \"underscore\"]],\n      \"5\" : [\"skirt\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This last example is far more complicated than you will usually see. Pend rescinds and petition rescinds are not common. Petitions are also quite rare, and gathering a good petition reason for each tag is often a pain.</p> <p>Note that the enumerated status keys in the service_keys_to_actions_to_tags structure are strings, not ints (JSON does not support int keys for Objects).</p> <p>The <code>override_previously_deleted_mappings</code> parameter adjusts your Add/Pend actions. In the client, if a human, in the manage tags dialog, tries to add a tag mapping that has been previously deleted, that deleted record will be overwritten. An automatic system like a gallery parser will filter/skip any Add/Pend actions in this case (so that repeat downloads do not overwrite a human user delete, etc..). The Client API acts like a human, by default, overwriting previously deleted mappings. If you want to spam a lot of new mappings but do not want to overwrite previously deletion decisions, acting like a downloader, then set this to <code>false</code>.</p> <p>The <code>create_new_deleted_mappings</code> parameter adjusts your Delete/Petition actions, particularly whether a delete record should be made even if the tag does not exist on the file. There are not many ways to spontaneously create a delete record in the normal hydrus UI, but you as the Client API should think whether this is what you want. By default, the Client API will write a delete record whether the tag already exists for the file or not. If you only want to create a delete record (which prohibits the tag being added back again by something like a downloader, as with <code>override_previously_deleted_mappings</code>) when the tag already exists on the file, then set this to <code>false</code>. Are you saying 'migrate all these deleted tag records from A to B so that none of them are re-added'? Then you want this <code>true</code>. Are you saying 'This tag was applied incorrectly to some but perhaps not all of of these files; where it exists, delete it.'? Then set it <code>false</code>.</p> <p>There is currently no way to delete a tag mapping without leaving a delete record (as you can with files). This will probably happen, though, and it'll be a new parameter here.</p> Response description: 200 and no content. <p>Note</p> <p>Note also that hydrus tag actions are safely idempotent. You can pend a tag that is already pended, or add a tag that already exists, and not worry about an error--the surplus add action will be discarded. The same is true if you try to pend a tag that actually already exists, or rescinding a petition that doesn't. Any invalid actions will fail silently.</p> <p>It is fine to just throw your 'process this' tags at every file import and not have to worry about checking which files you already added them to.</p>"},{"location":"developer_api.html#add_tags_set_favourite_tags","title":"POST <code>/add_tags/set_favourite_tags</code>","text":"<p>Edit the client's favourite tags.

The client records timestamps up to millisecond accuracy.</p> <p>You have to select some files, obviously. I'd imagine most uses will be over one file at a time, but you can spam 100 or 10,000 if you need to.</p> <p>Then choose whether you want to work with <code>timestamp</code> or <code>timestamp_ms</code>. <code>timestamp</code> can be an integer or a float, and in the latter case, the API will suck up the three most significant digits to be the millisecond data. <code>timestamp_ms</code> is an integer of milliseconds, simply the <code>timestamp</code> value multiplied by 1,000. It doesn't matter which you use--whichever is easiest for you.</p> <p>If you send <code>null</code> timestamp time, then this will instruct to delete the existing value, if possible and reasonable.</p> <p><code>timestamp_type</code> is an enum as follows:</p> <ul> <li>0 - File modified time (web domain)</li> <li>1 - File modified time (on the hard drive)</li> <li>3 - File import time</li> <li>4 - File delete time</li> <li>5 - Archived time</li> <li>6 - Last viewed (in the media viewer)</li> <li>7 - File originally imported time</li> </ul> <p>Adding or Deleting</p> <p>You can add or delete type 0 (web domain) timestamps, but you can only edit existing instances of all the others. This is broadly how the manage times dialog works, also. Stuff like 'last viewed' is tied up with other numbers like viewtime and num_views, so if that isn't already in the database, then we can't just add the timestamp on its own. Same with 'deleted time' for a file that isn't deleted! So, in general, other than web domain stuff, you can only edit times you already see in /get_files/file_metadata.</p> <p>If you select 0, you have to include a <code>domain</code>, which will usually be a web domain, but you can put anything in there.</p> <p>If you select 1, the client will not alter the modified time on your hard disk, only the database record.

Here's a big list of examples that are supported:</p> System Predicates <ul> <li>system:everything</li> <li>system:inbox</li> <li>system:archive</li> <li>system:has duration</li> <li>system:no duration</li> <li>system:is the best quality file of its duplicate group</li> <li>system:is not the best quality file of its duplicate group</li> <li>system:has audio</li> <li>system:no audio</li> <li>system:has exif</li> <li>system:no exif</li> <li>system:has embedded metadata</li> <li>system:no embedded metadata</li> <li>system:has icc profile</li> <li>system:no icc profile</li> <li>system:has tags</li> <li>system:no tags</li> <li>system:untagged</li> <li>system:number of tags &gt; 5</li> <li>system:number of tags ~= 10</li> <li>system:number of tags &gt; 0</li> <li>system:number of words &lt; 2</li> <li>system:height = 600</li> <li>system:height &gt; 900</li> <li>system:width &lt; 200</li> <li>system:width &gt; 1000</li> <li>system:filesize ~= 50 kilobytes</li> <li>system:filesize &gt; 10megabytes</li> <li>system:filesize &lt; 1 GB</li> <li>system:filesize &gt; 0 B</li> <li>system:similar to abcdef01 abcdef02 abcdef03, abcdef04 with distance 3</li> <li>system:similar to abcdef distance 5</li> <li>system:limit = 100</li> <li>system:filetype = image/jpg, image/png, apng</li> <li>system:hash = abcdef01 abcdef02 abcdef03 (this does sha256)</li> <li>system:hash = abcdef01 abcdef02 md5</li> <li>system:modified date &lt; 7 years 45 days 7h</li> <li>system:modified date &gt; 2011-06-04</li> <li>system:last viewed time &lt; 7 years 45 days 7h</li> <li>system:last view time &lt; 7 years 45 days 7h</li> <li>system:date modified &gt; 7 years 2 months</li> <li>system:date modified &lt; 0 years 1 month 1 day 1 hour</li> <li>system:import time &lt; 7 years 45 days 7h</li> <li>system:time imported &lt; 7 years 45 days 7h</li> <li>system:time imported &gt; 2011-06-04</li> <li>system:time imported &gt; 7 years 2 months</li> <li>system:time imported &lt; 0 years 1 month 1 day 1 hour</li> <li>system:time imported ~= 2011-1-3</li> <li>system:time imported ~= 1996-05-2</li> <li>system:duration &lt; 5 seconds</li> <li>system:duration ~= 600 msecs</li> <li>system:duration &gt; 3 milliseconds</li> <li>system:file service is pending to my files</li> <li>system:file service currently in my files</li> <li>system:file service is not currently in my files</li> <li>system:file service is not pending to my files</li> <li>system:number of file relationships = 2 duplicates</li> <li>system:number of file relationships &gt; 10 potential duplicates</li> <li>system:num file relationships &lt; 3 alternates</li> <li>system:num file relationships &gt; 3 false positives</li> <li>system:ratio is wider than 16:9</li> <li>system:ratio is 16:9</li> <li>system:ratio taller than 1:1</li> <li>system:num pixels &gt; 50 px</li> <li>system:num pixels &lt; 1 megapixels</li> <li>system:num pixels ~= 5 kilopixel</li> <li>system:views in media ~= 10</li> <li>system:views in preview &lt; 10</li> <li>system:views &gt; 0</li> <li>system:viewtime in client api &lt; 1 days 1 hour 0 minutes</li> <li>system:viewtime in media, client api, preview ~= 1 day 30 hours 100 minutes 90s</li> <li>system:has url matching regex index\\.php</li> <li>system:does not have a url matching regex index\\.php</li> <li>system:has url https://somebooru.org/posts/123456</li> <li>system:does not have url https://somebooru.org/posts/123456</li> <li>system:has domain somebooru.com</li> <li>system:does not have domain somebooru.com</li> <li>system:has a url with class somebooru file page</li> <li>system:does not have a url with url class somebooru file page</li> <li>system:tag as number page &lt; 5</li> <li>system:has notes</li> <li>system:no notes</li> <li>system:does not have notes</li> <li>system:num notes is 5</li> <li>system:num notes &gt; 1</li> <li>system:has note with name note name</li> <li>system:no note with name note name</li> <li>system:does not have note with name note name</li> <li>system:has a rating for <code>service_name</code></li> <li>system:does not have a rating for <code>service_name</code></li> <li>system:rating for <code>service_name</code> &gt; \u2157 (numerical services)</li> <li>system:rating for <code>service_name</code> is like (like/dislike services)</li> <li>system:rating for <code>service_name</code> = 13 (inc/dec services)</li> </ul> <p>Please test out the system predicates you want to send. If you are in help-&gt;advanced mode, you can test this parser in the advanced text input dialog when you click the OR* button on a tag autocomplete dropdown. More system predicate types and input formats will be available in future. Reverse engineering system predicate data from text is obviously tricky. If a system predicate does not parse, you'll get 400.</p> <p>Also, OR predicates are now supported! Just nest within the tag list, and it'll be treated like an OR. For instance:</p> <ul> <li><code>[ \"skirt\", [ \"samus aran\", \"lara croft\" ], \"system:height &gt; 1000\" ]</code></li> </ul> <p>Makes:</p> <ul> <li>skirt</li> <li>samus aran OR lara croft</li> <li>system:height &gt; 1000</li> </ul> <p>The file and tag services are for search domain selection, just like clicking the buttons in the client. They are optional--default is 'combined local file domains' and 'all known tags'.</p> <p><code>include_current_tags</code> and <code>include_pending_tags</code> do the same as the buttons on the normal search interface. They alter the search of normal tags and tag-related system predicates like 'system:number of tags', including or discluding that type of tag from whatever the search is doing. If you set both of these to <code>false</code>, you'll often get no results.</p> <p>File searches occur in the <code>display</code> <code>tag_display_type</code>. If you want to pair autocomplete tag lookup from /search_tags to this file search (e.g. for making a standard booru search interface), then make sure you are searching <code>display</code> tags there.</p> <p>file_sort_asc is 'true' for ascending, and 'false' for descending. The default is descending.</p> <p>file_sort_type is by default import time. It is an integer according to the following enum, and I have written the semantic (asc/desc) meaning for each type after:</p> <ul> <li>0 - file size (smallest first/largest first)</li> <li>1 - duration (shortest first/longest first)</li> <li>2 - import time (oldest first/newest first)</li> <li>3 - filetype (N/A)</li> <li>4 - random (N/A)</li> <li>5 - width (slimmest first/widest first)</li> <li>6 - height (shortest first/tallest first)</li> <li>7 - ratio (tallest first/widest first)</li> <li>8 - number of pixels (ascending/descending)</li> <li>9 - number of tags (on the current tag domain) (ascending/descending)</li> <li>10 - number of media views (ascending/descending)</li> <li>11 - total media viewtime (ascending/descending)</li> <li>12 - approximate bitrate (smallest first/largest first)</li> <li>13 - has audio (audio first/silent first)</li> <li>14 - modified time (oldest first/newest first)</li> <li>15 - framerate (slowest first/fastest first)</li> <li>16 - number of frames (smallest first/largest first)</li> <li>18 - last viewed time (oldest first/newest first)</li> <li>19 - archive timestamp (oldest first/newest first)</li> <li>20 - hash hex (lexicographic/reverse lexicographic)</li> <li>21 - pixel hash hex (lexicographic/reverse lexicographic)</li> <li>22 - blurhash (lexicographic/reverse lexicographic)</li> <li>23 - average colour - lightness (darkest first/lightest first)</li> <li>24 - average colour - chromatic magnitude (greys first/colours first)</li> <li>25 - average colour - green/red axis (greens first/reds first)</li> <li>26 - average colour - blue/yellow axis (blues first/yellows first)</li> <li>27 - average colour - hue (rainbow - red first/rainbow - purple first)</li> </ul> <p>The pixel, blurhash, and average colour sorts will put files without one of these (e.g. an mp3) at the end, regardless of asc/desc.</p> Response: <p>The full list of numerical file ids that match the search.

The order of both lists is the same.</p> <p>File ids are internal and specific to an individual client. For a client, a file with hash H always has the same file id N, but two clients will have different ideas about which N goes with which H. IDs are a bit faster to retrieve than hashes and search with en masse, which is why they are exposed here.</p> <p>This search does not apply the implicit limit that most clients set to all searches (usually 10,000), so if you do system:everything on a client with millions of files, expect to get boshed. Even with a system:limit included, complicated queries with large result sets may take several seconds to respond.

This file is the most useful representative when you do comparisons, since if you say \"King A &gt; King B\", then we know that King A is also better than all of King B's normal duplicate group members. We can merge the group simply just by folding King B and all the other members into King A's group.</p> <p>So what happens if you say 'A = B'? We have to have a king, so which should it be?</p> <p>What happens if you say \"non-king member of A &gt; non-king member of B\"? We don't want to merge all of B into A, since King B might be higher quality than King A.</p> <p>The logic here can get tricky, but I have tried my best to avoid overcommitting and accidentally promoting the wrong king. Here are all the possible situations ('&gt;' means 'better than', and '=' means 'same quality as'):</p> Merges <ul> <li>King A &gt; King B  <ul> <li>Merge B into A</li> <li>King A is king of the new combined group</li> </ul> </li> <li>Non-King A &gt; King B<ul> <li>Merge B into A</li> <li>King of A is king of the new combined group</li> </ul> </li> <li>King A &gt; Non-King B<ul> <li>Remove Non-King B from B and merge it into A</li> <li>King A stays king of A</li> <li>King of B stays king of B</li> </ul> </li> <li>Non-King A &gt; Non-King B<ul> <li>Remove Non-King B from B and merge it into A</li> <li>King of A stays king of A</li> <li>King of B stays king of B</li> </ul> </li> <li>King A = King B<ul> <li>Merge B into A</li> <li>King A is king of the new combined group</li> </ul> </li> <li>Non-King A = King B<ul> <li>Merge B into A</li> <li>King of A is king of the new combined group</li> </ul> </li> <li>King A = Non-King B<ul> <li>Merge A into B</li> <li>King of B is king of the new combined group</li> </ul> </li> <li>Non-King A = Non-King B<ul> <li>Remove Non-King B from B and merge it into A</li> <li>King of A stays king of A</li> <li>King of B stays king of B</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>So, if you can, always present kings to your users, and action using those kings' hashes.

If it cannot present a king (e.g. some group members are in the file domain, but the king is deleted, say), hydrus will not count that as a potential duplicate pair in that potential duplicate pair search.

If there is a matching URL Class, we suddenly know if a URL should be slotted into a particular space and parsed in a particular way.</p> <p>You may have noticed in the Edit GUG ui that it lists if a current URL Class matches the example URL output. We need a matching URL Class to 'catch' the GUG's output. If the GUG's output URL has no matching URL Class, then Hydrus won't know what to do with it, and it won't be listed in the main 'gallery selector' button's list--it'll be relegated to the 'non-functioning' section. If we have a matching URL Class, though, we know which parser to assign it. Where do we link URL Classes and Parsers? Under network-&gt;downloader components-&gt;manage url class links:</p> <p></p> <p>Here you simply set which goes with which. If you have URL Classes that do not have a parser linked (which is the default for new URL Classes), you can use the 'try to fill in gaps...' button to automatically fill the gaps based on guesses using the parsers' example URLs. This auto-connection happens a bunch behind the scenes, so don't be surprised if hydrus has figured out where things should go by itself. If there are multiple potential parsers with example URLs matching that URL Class, it'll usually go by the parser name earliest in the alphabet. It is good to double-check any complicated situation yourself.</p> <p>If the URL Class has no parser set or the parser is broken or otherwise invalid, the respective URL's file import object in the downloader or subscription is going to throw some kind of error when it runs.</p> <p>manage url class links also shows 'api/redirect link review', which summarises which URL Classes redirect to others. In these cases, only the redirected-to URL gets a parser entry in the first 'parser links' window, since the first will never be fetched for parsing (in the downloader, it will always be converted to the Redirected URL, and that is fetched and parsed).</p> <p>Once your GUG has a URL Class and your URL Classes have parsers linked, test your downloader! Note that Hydrus's URL drag-and-drop import uses URL Classes, so if you don't have the GUG and gallery stuff done but you have a Post URL set up, you can test that just by dragging a Post URL from your browser to the client, and it should be added to a new URL Downloader and just work. It feels pretty good once it does!</p> <p>If you make and share some parsers, it may well break one day. The first indication that something is wrong is going to be several users saying 'I got this error: (copy notes from file log window)'. if you can, load the parser or URL Class or GUG back up in the manage dialogs (it is usually the parser, after the site formatting changes) and try to figure out what changed and roll out an update.</p>"},{"location":"downloader_gugs.html","title":"Gallery URL Generators","text":"<p>Gallery URL Generators, or GUGs are simple objects that take a simple string from the user, like:</p> <ul> <li>blue_eyes</li> <li>blue_eyes blonde_hair</li> <li>InCase</li> <li>elsa dandon_fuga</li> <li>wlop</li> <li>goth* order:id_asc</li> </ul> <p>And convert them into an initialising Gallery URL, such as:</p> <ul> <li>http://safebooru.org/index.php?page=post&amp;s=list&amp;tags=blue_eyes&amp;pid=0</li> <li>https://konachan.com/post?page=1&amp;tags=blonde_hair+blue_eyes</li> <li>https://www.hentai-foundry.com/pictures/user/InCase/page/1</li> <li>http://rule34.paheal.net/post/list/elsa dandon_fuga/1</li> <li>https://www.deviantart.com/wlop/favourites/?offset=0</li> <li>https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?page=1&amp;tags=goth*+order:id_asc</li> </ul> <p>These are all the 'first page' of the results if you type or click-through to the same location on those sites.

Let's look at the ui under network-&gt;downloader components-&gt;manage gugs:</p> <p></p> <p>The client will split whatever the user enters by whitespace, so <code>blue_eyes blonde_hair</code> becomes two search terms, <code>[ 'blue_eyes', 'blonde_hair' ]</code>, which are then joined back together with the given 'search terms separator', to make <code>blue_eyes+blonde_hair</code>. Different sites use different separators, although ' ', '+', and ',' are most common. The new string is substituted into the <code>%tags%</code> in the template phrase, and the URL is made.</p> <p>Note that you will not have to make %20 or %3A percent-encodings for reserved characters here--the network engine handles all that before the request is sent. For the most part, if you need to include or a user puts in ':' or ' ' or '\u304a\u3063\u3071\u3044', you can just pass it along straight into the final URL without worrying.</p> <p>This ui should update as you change it, so have a play and look at how the output example url changes to get a feel for things. Look at the other defaults to see different examples. Even if you break something, you can just cancel out.</p> <p>The name of the GUG is important, as this is what will be listed when the user chooses what 'downloader' they want to use. Make sure it has a clear unambiguous name.</p> <p>The initial search text is also important. Most downloaders just take some text tags, but if your GUG expects a numerical artist id (like pixiv artist search does), you should specify that explicitly to the user. You can even put in a brief '(two tag maximum)' type of instruction if you like.</p> <p>Notice that the Deviart Art example above is actually the stream of wlop's favourites, not his works, and without an explicit notice of that, a user could easily mistake what they have selected.

URL Downloader This does just the Gallery Downloader's back-end--instead of taking a string query, it takes the gallery or post URLs directly from the user, whether that is one from a drag-and-drop event or hundreds pasted from clipboard. For our purposes here, the URL Downloader is a subset of the Gallery Downloader. Watcher This takes a URL that it will check in timed intervals, parsing it for new URLs that it then queues up to be downloaded. It typically stops checking after the 'file velocity' (such as '1 new file per day') drops below a certain level. It is mostly for watching imageboard threads.

File URL is considered the 'default', so if the client finds no match, it will assume the URL is a file and try to download and import the result.

Let's look at the metadata first:</p> Name and type <p>Like with GUGs, we should set a good unambiguous name so the client can clearly summarise this url to the user. 'tbib file page' is good.</p> <p>This is a Post URL, so we set the 'post url' type.</p> Association logic <p>All boorus and most sites only present one file per page, but some sites present multiple files on one page, usually several pages in a series/comic, as with pixiv. Danbooru-style thumbnail links to 'this file has a post parent' do not count here--I mean that a single URL embeds multiple full-size images, either with shared or separate tags. It is very important to the hydrus client's downloader logic (making decisions about whether it has previously visited a URL, so whether to skip checking it again) that if a site can present multiple files on a single page that 'can produce multiple files' is checked.</p> <p>Related is the idea of whether a 'known url' should be associated. Typically, this should be checked for Post and File URLs, which are fixed, and unchecked for Gallery and Watchable URLs, which are ephemeral and give different results from day to day. There are some unusual exceptions, so give it a brief thought--but if you have no special reason, leave this as the default for the url type.</p> <p>And now, for matching the string itself, let's revisit our four components:</p> Scheme TBIB supports http and https, so I have set the 'preferred' scheme to https. Any 'http' TBIB URL a user inputs will be automatically converted to https. Location/Domain <p>For Post URLs, the domain is always \"tbib.org\".</p> <p>The 'allow' and 'keep' subdomains checkboxes let you determine if a URL with \"artistname.artsite.com\" will match a URL Class with \"artsite.com\" domain and if that subdomain should be remembered going forward. Most sites do not host content on subdomains, so you can usually leave 'match' unchecked. The 'keep' option (which is only available if 'keep' is checked) is more subtle, only useful for rare cases, and unless you have a special reason, you should leave it checked. (For keep: In cases where a site farms out File URLs to CDN servers on subdomains--like randomly serving a mirror of \"https://muhbooru.org/file/123456\" on \"https://srv2.muhbooru.org/file/123456\"--and removing the subdomain still gives a valid URL, you may not wish to keep the subdomain.) Since TBIB does not use subdomains, these options do not matter--we can leave both unchecked.</p> <p>'www' and 'www2' and similar subdomains are automatically matched. Don't worry about them.</p> Path Components TBIB just uses a single \"index.php\" on the root directory, so the path is not complicated. Were it longer (like \"gallery/cgi/index.php\", we would add more (\"gallery\" and \"cgi\"), and since the path of a URL has a strict order, we would need to arrange the items in the listbox there so they were sorted correctly. Parameters TBIB's index.php takes many parameters to render different page types. Note that the Post URL uses \"s=view\", while TBIB Gallery URLs use \"s=list\". In any case, for a Post URL, \"id\", \"page\", and \"s\" are necessary and sufficient."},{"location":"downloader_url_classes.html#string_matches","title":"string matches","text":"<p>As you edit these components, you will be presented with the Edit String Match Panel:</p> <p></p> <p>This lets you set the type of string that will be valid for that component.

If you only just started hydrus, this is the checkpoint where you stop, spend a couple weeks getting more comfortable with stuff, and come back later. I recommend you take it slow and set time aside to read this whole document.</p> <p>As files are shared on the internet, they are often resized, cropped, or converted to a new file format. They can also be edited to a new file, whether than is just a small alteration or correction, or turned into a template and reinterpreted over and over and over. Even if you have a very restrictive importing workflow, your client is almost certainly going to get some duplicates. We would like to keep the interesting similar-looking alternates, like costume changes or work-in-progress transitions, while deleting the lower-quality duplicates where the only notable difference is some muddy jpeg artifacting. Along the way, it would be nice to merge the metadata from the worse files to the better so we do preserve what is useful.</p> <p>Finding and processing duplicates within a large collection is impossible to do by hand, so I have written a system to do the heavy lifting for you. It works on still images like jpegs and pngs, but advanced users have some ways to inject animation and video matches into the system.</p> <p>Hydrus finds pairs of potential duplicates using a search algorithm that compares images by their shape. It is sensitive enough to recognise two images of the same character in the exact same pose, but it will not recognise smaller differences like a hair or finger placement correction by the artist, a tear or sweat drops, or basic colour swaps.</p> <p>Once it discovers potential duplicate pairs, they are presented to you through a filter like the archive/delete filter so you can tell the client their true relationship and if you would like to delete any 'worse' duplicate. All of your decisions build up in the database to form logically consistent groups of duplicates and 'alternate' relationships that can be used to infer future information. For instance, if you say that file A is a duplicate of B and B is a duplicate of C, A and C are automatically recognised as duplicates as well.</p> <p>Note that 'potential duplicates' are not the same as 'duplicates'. Some common terms:</p> <ul> <li>Potential duplicates are pairs of files that could be duplicates; most likely hydrus has determined look very similar to each other during its background potential duplicate discovery work.</li> <li>Duplicates are pairs or larger groups of files that you have confirmed are different quality or resolution copies of the same source file. Every duplicate group has one 'king' or 'best quality file'.</li> <li>Alternates are pairs or larger groups of files that are related in some way but are not duplicates (e.g. costume change, WIPs).</li> </ul> <p>When you are using the systems described on this page, you will usually be preparing queues of 'potential duplicate' pairs to process into confirmed 'duplicates' or 'alternates'. Setting a firm file relationship will remove an existing 'potential duplicates' relationships they have; similarly, files that currently are duplicates or alternates will not naturally appear again as 'potential duplicates'--the question has been resolved.</p> <p>What this system is and is not</p> <p>At the moment, this system is heavily on the side of dealing with duplicates by deleting bad files and merging metadata. The logic and inference is very smart and makes your life easier, but it is mostly hidden away. There is no nice UI to review and rearrange file relationships, nor a detailed audit log for every single decision you made.</p> <p>Support for 'alternates' and file relationship categorisation is planned for a future expansion but for now is essentially non-existent. We just dump these files in a special place for now.    </p> <p>We are here to get work done. If you are good to clear out some wasteful stuff, let's go. If you want to curate things to a very fine degree, I recommend you only dip your toes in here and pick what works for you.</p> <p>Also, there is a little wiggle room between a duplicate and an alternate (e.g. if one of a pair has a watermark or a censorship mark). I don't recommend keeping anything you don't want to look at again, nor bothering to record detailed relationship info about something you are going to delete, but you get to decide which you prefer.

If \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are duplicate groups that each have one or more files, then setting (\u03b1 alt \u03b2) and (\u03b2 alt \u03b3) creates an alternate group (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3), with the caveat that \u03b1 and \u03b3 will still be sent to the duplicate filter once just to check they are not duplicates by chance. The specific file members of these groups, A, B, C and so on, inherit the relationships of their parent groups when you right-click on their thumbnails.</p> <p>False positive relationships are stored between pairs of alternate groups, so they apply transitively between all the files of either side's alternate group. If (\u03b1 alt \u03b2) and (\u03c8 alt \u03c9) and you apply (\u03b1 fp \u03c8), then (\u03b1 fp \u03c9), (\u03b2 fp \u03c8), and (\u03b2 fp \u03c9) are all transitively implied.</p> More examples <p> </p>"},{"location":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","text":""},{"location":"faq.html#repositories","title":"What is a repository?","text":"<p>A repository is a service in the hydrus network that stores a certain kind of information--files or tag mappings, for instance--as submitted by users all over the internet. Those users periodically synchronise with the repository so they know everything that it stores. Sometimes, like with tags, this means creating a complete local copy of everything on the repository. Hydrus network clients never send queries to repositories; they perform queries over their local cache of the repository's data, keeping everything confined to the same computer.</p>"},{"location":"faq.html#tags","title":"What is a tag?","text":"<p>Wikipedia</p> <p>A tag is a small bit of text describing a single property of something. They make searching easy. Good examples are \"flower\" or \"nicolas cage\" or \"the sopranos\" or \"2003\". By combining several tags together ( e.g. [ 'tiger woods', 'sports illustrated', '2008' ] or [ 'cosplay', 'the legend of zelda' ] ), a huge image collection is reduced to a tiny and easy-to-digest sample.</p> <p>A good word for the connection of a particular tag to a particular file is mapping.</p> <p>Hydrus is designed with the intention that tags are for searching, not describing. Workflows and UI are tuned for finding files and other similar files (e.g. by the same artist), and while it is possible to have nice metadata overlays around files, this is not considered their chief purpose. Trying to have 'perfect' descriptions for files is often a rabbit-hole that can consume hours of work with relatively little demonstrable benefit.</p> <p>All tags are automatically converted to lower case. 'Sunset Drive' becomes 'sunset drive'. Why?</p> <ol> <li>Although it is more beautiful to have 'The Lord of the Rings' rather than 'the lord of the rings', there are many, many special cases where style guides differ on which words to capitalise.</li> <li>As 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'the lord of the rings' are semantically identical, it is natural to search in a case insensitive way. When case does not matter, what point is there in recording it?</li> </ol> <p>Furthermore, leading and trailing whitespace is removed, and multiple whitespace is collapsed to a single character.</p> <p>'  yellow   dress '</p> <p>becomes</p> <p>'yellow dress'</p>"},{"location":"faq.html#namespaces","title":"What is a namespace?","text":"<p>A namespace is a category that in hydrus prefixes a tag. An example is 'person' in the tag 'person:ron paul'--it lets people and software know that 'ron paul' is a name. You can create any namespace you like; just type one or more words and then a colon, and then the next string of text will have that namespace.</p> <p>The hydrus client gives namespaces different colours so you can pick out important tags more easily in a large list, and you can also search by a particular namespace, even creating complicated predicates like 'give all files that do not have any character tags', for instance.</p>"},{"location":"faq.html#filenames","title":"Why not use filenames and folders?","text":"<p>As a retrieval method, filenames and folders are less and less useful as the number of files increases. Why?</p> <ul> <li>A filename is not unique; did you mean this \"04.jpg\" or this \"04.jpg\" in another folder? Perhaps \"04 (3).jpg\"?</li> <li>A filename is not guaranteed to describe the file correctly, e.g. hello.jpg</li> <li>A filename is not guaranteed to stay the same, meaning other programs cannot rely on the filename address being valid or even returning the same data every time.</li> <li> <p>A filename is often--for ridiculous reasons--limited to a certain prohibitive character set. Even when utf-8 is supported, some arbitrary ascii characters are usually not, and different localisations, operating systems and formatting conventions only make it worse.</p> </li> <li> <p>Folders can offer context, but they are clunky and time-consuming to change. If you put each chapter of a comic in a different folder, for instance, reading several volumes in one sitting can be a pain. Nesting many folders adds navigation-latency and tends to induce less informative \"04.jpg\"-type filenames.</p> </li> </ul> <p>So, the client tracks files by their hash. This technical identifier easily eliminates duplicates and permits the database to robustly attach other metadata like tags and ratings and known urls and notes and everything else, even across multiple clients and even if a file is deleted and later imported.</p> <p>As a general rule, I suggest you not set up hydrus to parse and display all your imported files' filenames as tags. 'image.jpg' is useless as a tag. Shed the concept of filenames as you would chains.</p>"},{"location":"faq.html#external_files","title":"Can the client manage files from their original locations?","text":"<p>When the client imports a file, it makes a quickly accessible but human-ugly copy in its internal database, by default under install_dir/db/client_files. When it needs to access that file again, it always knows where it is, and it can be confident it is what it expects it to be. It never accesses the original again.</p> <p>This storage method is not always convenient, particularly for those who are hesitant about converting to using hydrus completely and also do not want to maintain two large copies of their collections. The question comes up--\"can hydrus track files from their original locations, without having to copy them into the db?\"</p> <p>The technical answer is, \"This support could be added,\" but I have decided not to, mainly because:</p> <ul> <li>Files stored in locations outside of hydrus's responsibility can change or go missing (particularly if a whole parent folder is moved!), which erodes the assumptions it makes about file access, meaning additional checks would have to be added before important operations, often with no simple recovery.</li> <li>External duplicates would not be merged, and the file system would have to be extended to handle pointless 1-&gt;n hash-&gt;path relationships.</li> <li>Many regular operations--like figuring out whether orphaned files should be physically deleted--are less simple.</li> <li>Backing up or restoring a distributed external file system is much more complicated.</li> <li>It would require more code to maintain and would mean a laggier db and interface.</li> <li>Hydrus is an attempt to get away from files and folders--if a collection is too large and complicated to manage using explorer, what's the point in supporting that old system?</li> </ul> <p>It is not unusual for new users who ask for this feature to find their feelings change after getting more experience with the software. If desired, path text can be preserved as tags using regexes during import, and getting into the swing of searching by metadata rather than navigating folders often shows how very effective the former is over the latter. Most users eventually import most or all of their collection into hydrus permanently, deleting their old folder structure as they go.</p> <p>For this reason, if you are hesitant about doing things the hydrus way, I advise you try running it on a smaller subset of your collection, say 5,000 files, leaving the original copies completely intact. After a month or two, think about how often you used hydrus to look at the files versus navigating through folders. If you barely used the folders, you probably do not need them any more, but if you used them a lot, then hydrus might not be for you, or it might only be for some sorts of files in your collection.</p>"},{"location":"faq.html#sqlite","title":"Why use SQLite?","text":"<p>Hydrus uses SQLite for its database engine. Some users who have experience with other engines such as MySQL or PostgreSQL sometimes suggest them as alternatives.

The simple answer is that they are unique names for things.

In the client's normal operation, you will never encounter a file's hash. If you want to see a thumbnail bigger, double-click it; the software handles the mathematics.</p> <p>For those who are interested: hydrus uses SHA-256, which spits out 32-byte (256-bit) hashes. The software stores the hash densely, as 32 bytes, only encoding it to 64 hex characters when the user views it or copies to clipboard. SHA-256 is not perfect, but it is a great compromise candidate; it is secure for now, it is reasonably fast, it is available for most programming languages, and newer CPUs perform it more efficiently all the time.</p>"},{"location":"faq.html#access_keys","title":"What is an access key?","text":"<p>The hydrus network's repositories do not use username/password, but instead a single strong identifier-password like this:</p> <p>7ce4dbf18f7af8b420ee942bae42030aab344e91dc0e839260fcd71a4c9879e3</p> <p>These hex numbers give you access to a particular account on a particular repository, and are often combined like so:</p> <p>7ce4dbf18f7af8b420ee942bae42030aab344e91dc0e839260fcd71a4c9879e3@hostname.com:45871</p> <p>They are long enough to be impossible to guess, and also randomly generated, so they reveal nothing personally identifying about you.

You can see these in review services and manage services. Although the services of the same type may interact (e.g. deleting a file from one service might send that file to the 'trash' service, or adding tag parents to one tag service might implicate tags on another), those of different types are generally completely independent. Your tags don't care where the files they map to are.</p> <p>So, when you delete a file from 'my files', none of its tag mappings in 'my tags' change--they remain attached to the 'ghost' of the deleted file. Your notes, ratings, and known URLs are the same (URLs is important, since it lets the client skip URLs for files you previously deleted). If you re-import the file, it will have everything it did before, with only a couple of pertinent changes like, obviously, import time.</p> <p>This is an important part of how the PTR works--when you sync with the PTR, your client downloads a couple billion mappings for files you do not have yet. Then, when you happen to import one of those files, it appears in your importer with its PTR tags 'apparently' already set--in truth, it always had them.</p> <p>When you feel like playing with some more advanced concepts, turn on help-&gt;advanced mode and open a new search page. Change the file domain from 'my files' to 'all known files' or 'deleted from my files' and start typing a common tag--you'll get autocomplete results with counts! You can even run the search, and you'll get a ton of 'non-local' and therefore non-viewable files that are typically given a default hydrus thumbnail. These are files that your client is aware of, but does not currently have. You can run the manage x dialogs and edit the metadata of these ghost files just as you can your real ones. The only thing hydrus ever needs to attach metadata to a file is the file's SHA256 hash.</p> <p>If you really want to delete the tags or other data for some files you deleted, then:</p> <ul> <li>If the job is small, do a search for the files inside 'deleted from my local files' (or 'all known files' if you did not leave a deletion record) and then hit <code>Ctrl+A-&gt;manage tags</code> and manually delete the tags there.</li> <li>If the job is very large, then make a backup and hit up tags-&gt;migrate tags. You can select the tag service x tag mappings for all files in 'deleted from my local files' and then make the action to delete from x again. </li> <li>If the job is complicated, then note that you can open the tags-&gt;migrate tags dialog from manage tags, and it will only apply to the files that booted manage tags.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq.html#does_this_deleted-file_metadata_take_up_a_lot_of_database_space_should_i_clear_it_to_get_rid_of_bloat","title":"Does this deleted-file metadata take up a lot of database space?

It is even more difficult to keep up with updates (e.g. someone adding a tag to a file some months or years after it was uploaded). This is the main problem I designed the PTR to solve.</p> <p>If you cannot or do not want to devote the local resources to sync with the PTR, there are a few hacky ways to perform tag lookups, mostly with manual hash-based lookups. The big boorus support file search based on 'md5' hash, so there are ways to build a workflow where you can 'search' a booru or iqdb for one file at a time to see if there is a hit, and then get tags as if you were downloading it. An old system in the client called 'file lookup scripts' works like this, in the manage tags dialog, and some users have figured out ways to make it work with some clever downloaders.</p> <p>Be careful with these systems. They tend to be slow and use a lot of resources serverside, so you will be rude if you hit them too hard. They work for a handful of files every now and then, but please do not set up jobs of many many thousands of files, and absolutely do not repeat the job for the same files regularly--you will just waste a lot of CPU and network time for everyone, and only gain a couple of tags in the process. Note that the hash-based lookups only work if your files have not changed since being downloaded; if you have scaled them, stripped metadata, or optimised quality, then they will count as new files and the hashes will have changed, and you will need to think about services like iqdb or saucenao, or ultimately the hydrus duplicate resolution system.</p> <p>That said, here is a user guide on how to perform various kinds of file lookups.</p> <p>If you are feeling adventurous, you can also explore the newer AI-tagging tools that users are working on.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, a good and simple way to backfill your files' tags is just rely on normal downloading workflows. Try downloading your favourite artists (and later set up subscriptions) and you will naturally get files you like, with tags, and if, by (expected) serendipity, a file on the site is the same as one you already imported, hydrus will add the tags to it retroactively. </p>"},{"location":"faq.html#encryption","title":"Does Hydrus run ok off an encrypted drive partition?","text":"<p>Yes!

It can pull from any booru or regular gallery site or imageboard, and also, to a smaller extent, special examples like twitter. A fresh install will by default have support for the bigger sites, but it is possible, with some work, for any user to create a new shareable downloader for a new site.</p> <p>The downloader is highly parallelisable, but the default bandwidth rules should stop you from running too hot and downloading so much at once that you annoy the servers you are downloading from.</p> <p>Danger</p> <p>It is very important that you take this slow. Many users get overexcited with their new ability to download 500,000 files and then do so, only discovering later that 98% of what they got was junk that they now have to wade through. Figure out what workflows work for you, how fast you process files, what content you actually want, how much bandwidth and hard drive space you have, and prioritise and throttle your incoming downloads to match. If you can realistically only archive/delete filter 50 files a day, there is little benefit to downloading 500 new files a day.</p> <p>START SLOW.</p> <p>It also takes a decent whack of CPU to import a file. You'll usually never notice this with just one hard drive import going, but if you have twenty different download queues all competing for database access and individual 0.1-second hits of heavy CPU work, you will discover your client starts to judder and lag. Keep it in mind, and you'll figure out what your computer is happy with. I also recommend you try to keep your total loaded files/urls to be under 20,000 to keep things snappy. Remember that you can pause your import queues, if you need to calm things down a bit.</p> <p>403 errors</p> <p>Hydrus's downloader tech is pretty old, and as the infrastructure of the internet changes, some things are breaking.</p> <p>You may get a 403 result for a search or file download. This is often because a CDN (e.g. CloudFlare) is gating the site with a captcha-like test. It can hit users in certain IP regions or VPN networks worse. The rules are often applied dynamically, so it sometimes passes within a week.</p> <p>The situation is, unfortunately, generally getting worse. Some users have had success with tools like Hydrus Companion, which can synchronise browser User-Agent and cookies to hydrus, but this is proving less reliable these days. Others have been experimenting with alternate downloaders that use official APIs. These are sometimes great; but some are very restricted and need a login. Check out the user-run downloader repository to see what people have figured out. There are also more sophisticated downloader solutions like hydownloader and gallery-dl, but these take some time to set up.</p> <p>Hydev is planning to retire default downloaders that become less reliable. I am not yet sure what I will do long-term, but I am thinking about it. Sorry for the trouble!</p>"},{"location":"getting_started_downloading.html#downloader_types","title":"Downloader types","text":"<p>There are several different downloader types, each with its own purpose:  </p> Gallery The normal booru-style search interface. You enter tags, and the downloader walks through one or more gallery pages, queueing up many post/file results. Good for big download jobs such as an artist's entire catalogue. Subscriptions Automatic, repeating gallery jobs, for keeping up to date with an artist or tag. Use the gallery downloader to get everything first and then set up a subscription to keep updated. Watcher For watching imageboard (e.g. 4chan) threads. It checks and rechecks regularly to keep up with new posts. (The API can send URLs to this) URL download You paste or drag-and-drop gallery and post/file URLs into this, and if hydrus understands it, it will import it. Does not do multi-page searching. Useful for one-off jobs. (The API can send URLs to this) Simple downloader Advanced. Intended for simple one-off jobs with a single simple parsing rule, like 'get all the linked images from this page'."},{"location":"getting_started_downloading.html#gallery_download","title":"Gallery download","text":"<p>The gallery page can download from multiple sources at the same time. Each entry in the list represents a basic combination of two things:</p> Source The site you are getting from. Safebooru or Danbooru or Deviant Art or twitter or anywhere else. In the example image this is the button labelled <code>artstation artist lookup</code>. Query text Something like 'contrapposto' or 'blonde_hair blue_eyes' or an artist name like 'incase'. Whatever is searched on the site to return a list of ordered media. In the example image this is the text field with <code>artist username</code> in it. <p>So, when you want to start a new download, you first select the source with the button and then type in a query in the text box and hit enter. The download will soon start and fill in information, and thumbnails should stream in, just like the hard drive importer. The downloader typically works by walking through the search's gallery pages one by one, queueing up the found files for later download. There are several intentional delays built into the system, so do not worry if work seems to halt for a little while--you will get a feel for hydrus's 'slow persistent growth' style with experience.</p> <p>Do a test download now, for fun! Pause its gallery search after a page or two, and then pause the file import queue after a dozen or so files come in.</p> <p>The thumbnail panel can only show results from one queue at a time, so double-click on an entry to 'highlight' it, which will show its thumbs and also give more detailed info and controls in the 'highlighted query' panel. I encourage you to explore the highlight panel over time, as it can show and do quite a lot. Double-click again to 'clear' it.</p> <p>It is a good idea to 'test' larger downloads, either by visiting the site itself for that query, or just waiting a bit and reviewing the first files that come in. Just make sure that you are getting what you thought you would, whether that be verifying that the query text is correct or that the site isn't only giving you bloated gifs or other bad quality files. The 'file limit', which stops the gallery search after the set number of files, is also great for limiting fishing expeditions (such as overbroad searches like 'wide_hips', which on the bigger boorus have 100k+ results and return variable quality). If the gallery search runs out of new files before the file limit is hit, the search will naturally stop (and the entry in the list should gain a \u23f9 'stop' symbol).</p> <p>Note that some sites only serve 25 or 50 pages of results, despite their indices suggesting hundreds. If you notice that one site always bombs out at, say, 500 results, it may be due to a decision on their end. You can usually test this by visiting the pages hydrus tried in your web browser.</p> <p>In general, particularly when starting out, artist searches are best. They are usually fewer than a thousand files and have fairly uniform quality throughout.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started_downloading.html#subscriptions","title":"Subscriptions","text":"<p>Let's say you found an artist you like. You downloaded everything of theirs from some site using a Gallery Downloader, but every week, one or two new pieces is posted. You'd like to keep up with the new stuff, but you don't want to manually make a new download job every week for every single artist you like.</p> <p>Subscriptions are a way to automatically recheck a good query in future, to keep up with new files. Many users come to use them. You set up a number of saved queries, and the client will 'sync' with the latest files in the gallery and download anything new, just as if you were running the download yourself.</p> <p>Sync Mechanics</p> <p>Because they are automatic, subscriptions are designed to be reliable, simple, and fail-safe. They build up an initial list of URLs (usually one hundred) for their search, and then on every normal sync they will re-run the search and stop looking once they hit a list of files they recognise.</p> <p>Once subscriptions establish a log of recent URLs, they will not go 'beyond' that, to older URLs. They will always get whatever is newest, stop when they catch up to what they have seen before, and integrate those newer URLs into their URL log for the next check.</p> <p>If you need to get older files and fill in that 'gap', use a one-time Gallery Downloader page.</p> <p>Subscriptions change how frequently they check based on what they see. If it looks like there are four new files every week, they will typically try to check once a week. A faster or slower 'file velocity' will cause them to automatically throttle up or down. If a source does not post any new files within a long time (usually 180 days), the subscription will be considered DEAD and will stop checking.</p> <p>The entire subscription system assumes the source is a typical 'newest first' booru-style search. If you dick around with some order_by:rating/random metatag, it will not work reliably!</p> <p>While subscriptions can have multiple queries (even hundreds!), they generally only work on one site. Expect to create one subscription for site x, another for site y, site z, and so on for every source you care about. Advanced users may be able to think of ways to get around this, but I recommend against it as it throws off some of the internal check timing calculations.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started_downloading.html#setting_up_subscriptions","title":"Setting up subscriptions","text":"<p>Here's the dialog, which is under network-&gt;manage subscriptions:</p> <p></p> <p>This is a very simple example--there is only one subscription, for safebooru.

When the subscription runs, it will put the given search text into the given download source just as if you were running the regular downloader.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Subscriptions syncs are somewhat fragile, and they work best in the small ~100 file range. Do not try to play with the limits or checker options to download a whole 5,000 file query in one go--if you want everything for a query, run it in the manual gallery downloader first, then set up a normal sub for new stuff.

Most of the controls have tooltips or longer explainers in sub-dialogs, so don't be afraid to try things.</p> <p>It is easy to get tens of thousands of tags by downloading this way. Different sites offer different kinds and qualities of tags, and the client's downloaders (which were designed by me, the dev, or a user) may parse all or only some of them. Many users like to just get everything on offer, but others only ever want, say, <code>creator</code>, <code>series</code>, and <code>character</code> tags.

Its downloaders are designed to run a marathon, not a sprint.</p> <p>It will not be too long until you see a \"bandwidth free in xxxxx...\" message. As a long-term storage solution, hydrus is designed to be polite in its downloading--both to the source server and your computer. It has complicated bandwidth rules that can operate in several different domains, and the default rules are capped conservatively to stop big mistakes and spread out larger jobs. For instance, at a bare minimum, no domain will be hit more than once a second.</p> <p>If you want to download 10,000 files, set up the queue and let it work.

I especially strongly recommend you not ever turn them all off, thinking that will improve something, as you'll probably render the client too laggy to function and get yourself an IP ban from the next server you pull from.</p> <p>Again: the real problem with downloading is not finding new things, it is keeping up with what you get. Start slow and figure out what is important to your bandwidth budget, hard drive budget, and free time budget.

Hydrus does not store credentials securely. Also, if you accidentally download too much at once, or a site suddenly changes their policies, a linked account can get banned. If you link an account to hydrus, always use a throwaway account you don't care much about.</p> <p>This system often breaks and is sometimes a hassle deal with! If you need to log in to anything more clever than a booru, use Hydrus Companion or similar to copy your cookies across!</p> <p>The client supports a very basic and ugly login system. It can handle simple sites and is as completely user-customisable as the downloader system. The client starts with multiple login scripts by default, which you can review under network-&gt;logins-&gt;manage logins:</p> <p></p> <p>Many sites grant all their content without you having to log in at all, but others require it for NSFW or special content, or you may wish to take advantage of site-side user preferences like personal blacklists. If you wish, you can give hydrus some login details here, and it will try to login--just as a browser would--before it downloads anything from that domain.</p> <p>To start using a login script, select the domain and click 'edit credentials'. You'll put in your username/password, and then 'activate' the login for the domain, and that should be it! The next time you try to get something from that site, the first request will wait (usually about ten seconds) while a login popup performs the login. Most logins last for about thirty days (and many refresh that 30-day timer every time you make a new request), so once you are set up, you usually never notice it again, especially if you have a subscription on the domain.</p> <p>Most sites only have one way of logging in, but hydrus does support more. Hentai Foundry is a good example--by default, the client performs the 'click-through' login as a guest, which requires no credentials and means any hydrus client can get any content from the start. But this way of logging in only lasts about 60 minutes or so before having to be refreshed, and it does not hide any spicy stuff, so if you use HF a lot, I recommend you create a throwaway account, set the filters you like in your HF profile (e.g. no guro content), and then click the 'change login script' in the client to the proper username/pass login.</p> <p>The login system is not very clever. Don't try to pull off anything too weird with it! If anything goes wrong, it will likely delay the script (and hence the whole domain) from working for a while, or invalidate it entirely. If the error is something simple, like a password typo or current server maintenance, go back to this dialog to fix and scrub the error and try again. If the site just changed its layout, you may need to update the login script. If it is more complicated, please contact me, hydrus_dev, with the details!</p> <p>If you would like to login to a site that is not yet supported by hydrus (usually ones with a Captcha in the login page), you have two options:</p> <ol> <li>Get a web browser add-on that lets you export a cookies.txt (either for the whole browser or just for that domain) from a browser that is logged in, and then drag and drop that cookies.txt file onto the hydrus network-&gt;data-&gt;review session cookies dialog. This sometimes does not work if your add-on's export formatting is unusual. If it does work, hydrus will import and use those cookies, which skips the login by making your hydrus pretend to be your browser directly. This is obviously advanced and hacky, so if you need to do it, let me know how you get on and what tools you find work best!</li> <li>Use Hydrus Companion browser add-on to do the same basic thing automatically.

You can extract it to a usb stick, move it from one place to another, have multiple installs for multiple purposes, wrap it all up inside an encrypted volume, whatever you like.

(i.e. on a different computer's hard drive) The SQLite database is sensitive to interruption and requires good file locking, which network interfaces often fake. There are ways of splitting your client up so the database is on a local SSD but the files are on a network--this is fine--but you really should not put the database on a remote machine unless you know what you are doing and have a backup in case things go wrong.</p> <p>Be careful installing to a location with filesystem-level compression or versioning enabled! It may work ok to start, but when the SQLite database grows to large size, this can cause extreme access latency. I have been told that BTRFS works well these days, and they have been working specifically to improve SQLite performance, but keep it in mind if you are using anything else. Using NTFS compression mode on the database files is not a good idea. Compressing a hydrus database backup is fine, but the live db is sensitive.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started_installing.html#anti_virus","title":"Anti-virus","text":"<p>Hydrus is made by an Anon out of duct tape and string. It combines file parsing tech with lots of network and database code in unusual and powerful ways, and all through a hacked-together executable that isn't signed by any big official company.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we have been hit by anti-virus false positives throughout development. Every few months, one or more of the larger anti-virus programs sees some code that looks like something bad, or they run the program in a testbed and don't like something it does, and then they quarantine it. Every single instance of this so far has been a false positive. They usually go away the next week or two when the next set of definitions roll out. Some hydrus users are kind enough to report the program as a false positive to the anti-virus companies themselves, which also helps.</p> <p>Some users have never had the problem, some get hit regularly. The situation is obviously worse on Windows. If you try to extract the zip and hydrus_client.exe or the whole folder suddenly disappears, please check your anti-virus software.</p> <p>I am interested in reports about these false-positives, just so I know what is going on. Sometimes I have been able to reduce problems by changing something in the build (one of these was, no shit, an anti-virus testbed running the installer and then opening the help html at the end, which launched Edge browser, which then triggered Windows Update, which hit UAC and was considered suspicious. I took out the 'open help' checkbox from the installer as a result).</p> <p>You should be careful about random software online. For my part, the program is completely open source, and I have a long track record of designing it with privacy foremost. There is no intentional spyware of any sort--the program never connects to another computer unless you tell it to. Furthermore, the exe you download is now built on github's cloud, so there are few worries about a trojan-infected build environment putting something I did not intend into the program. That doesn't stop Windows Defender from sometimes calling it an ugly name like \"Tedy.4675\" and definitively declaring \"This program is dangerous and executes commands from an attacker\" but that's the modern anti-virus ecosystem.</p> <p>There aren't excellent solutions to this problem. I don't like to say 'just exclude the program directory from your anti-virus settings', but some users are comfortable with this and say it works fine. One thing I do know that helps (with other things too), if you are using the default Windows Defender, is going into the Windows Security shield icon on your taskbar, and 'virus and threat protection' and then 'virus and threat protection settings', and turning off 'Cloud-delivered protection' and 'Automatic sample submission'. It seems with these on, Windows will talk with a central server about executables you run and download early updates, and this gives a lot of false positives.</p> <p>If you are still concerned, please feel free to run from source, as above. You are controlling everything, then, and can change anything about the program you like.

There are also no training wheels to stop you from accidentally overwriting your whole db if you screw around. Be careful when updating. Make backups beforehand!</p> <p>Hydrus does not auto-update. It will stay the same version unless you download and install a new one.</p> <p>Although I put out a new version every week, you can update far less often if you prefer. The client keeps to itself, so if it does exactly what you want and a new version does nothing you care about, you can just leave it. Other users enjoy updating every week, simply because it makes for a nice schedule. Others like to stay a week or two behind what is current, just in case I mess up and cause a temporary bug in something they like.</p> <p>The update process:</p> <ul> <li>If the client is running, close it!</li> <li>If you maintain a backup, run it now!</li> <li>Update your install:<ol> <li>If you use the installer, just download the new installer and run it. It should detect where the last install was and overwrite everything automatically.</li> <li>If you use the extract, then just extract the new version right on top of your current install and overwrite manually. It is wise to extract it straight from the archive to your install folder.</li> <li>If you run from source, then run <code>git pull</code> as normal. If it has been a few months since you made your venv, or the changelog talks about a new library version specifically, you might like to run <code>setup_venv</code> again.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Start your client or server. It may take a few minutes to update its database. I will say in the release post if it is likely to take longer.</li> </ul> <p>A user has written a longer and more formal guide to updating here.</p> Be extremely careful making test runs of the Extract release <p>Do not test-run the extract before copying it over your install! Running the program anywhere will create database files in the /db/ dir, and if you then copy that once-run folder on top of your real install, you will overwrite your real database! Of course it doesn't really matter, because you made a full backup before you started, right? :^)</p> <p>If you need to perform tests of an update, make sure you have a good backup before you start and then remember to delete any functional test extracts before extracting from the original archive once more for the actual 'install'.</p> <p>Several older versions, like 334, 526, and 570 have special update instructions.</p> <p>Unless the update specifically disables or reconfigures something, all your files and tags and settings will be remembered after the update.</p> <p>Releases typically need to update your database to their version. New releases can retroactively perform older database updates, so if the new version is v255 but your database is on v250, you generally only need to get the v255 release, and it'll do all the intervening v250-&gt;v251, v251-&gt;v252, etc... update steps in order as soon as you boot it. If you need to update from a release more than, say, ten versions older than current, see below. You might also like to skim the release posts or changelog to see what is new.</p> <p>Clients and servers of different versions can usually connect to one another, but from time to time, I make a change to the network protocol, and you will get polite error messages if you try to connect to a newer server with an older client or vice versa. There is still no need to update the client--it'll still do local stuff like searching for files completely fine.

A handful of hydrus updates through its history have needed this.</p> <p>Very rarely, hydrus needs a clean install. This can be due to a special update like when we moved from 32-bit to 64-bit or needing to otherwise 'reset' a custom install situation. The problem is usually that a library file has been renamed in a new version and hydrus has trouble figuring out whether to use the older one (from a previous version) or the newer.</p> <p>In any case, if you cannot boot hydrus and it either fails silently or you get a crash log or system-level error popup complaining in a technical way about not being able to load a dll/pyd/so file, you may need a clean install, which essentially means clearing any old files out and reinstalling.</p> <p>However, you need to be careful not to delete your database! It sounds silly, but at least one user has made a mistake here. The process is simple, do not deviate:</p> <ul> <li>Make a backup if you can!</li> <li>Go to your install directory.</li> <li>Delete all the files and folders except the 'db' dir (and all of its contents, obviously).</li> <li>Extract the new version of hydrus as you normally do.</li> </ul> <p>After that, you'll have a 'clean' version of hydrus that only has the latest version's dlls. If hydrus still will not boot, I recommend you roll back to your last working backup and let me, hydrus dev, know what your error is.</p> <p>Note that macOS App users will not ever have to do a clean install because every App is self-contained and non-merging with previous Apps. Source users similarly do not have to worry about this issue, although if they update their system python, they'll want to recreate their venv. Windows Installer users basically get a clean install every time, so they shouldn't have to worry about this.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started_installing.html#big_updates","title":"Big updates","text":"<p>If you have not updated in some time--say twenty versions or more--doing it all in one jump, like v290-&gt;v330, may not work.

Hydrus update code often falls to bit rot, and so some underlying truth I assumed for the v299-&gt;v300 code may not still apply six months later. If you try to update more than 50 versions at once (i.e. trying to perform more than a year of updates in one go), the client will give you a polite error rather than even try.</p> <p>As a result, if you get a failure on trying to do a big update, try cutting the distance in half--try v290-&gt;v310 first, and boot it. If the database updates correctly and the program boots, then shut down and move on to v310-&gt;v330. If the update does not work, cut down the gap and try v290-&gt;v300, and so on.

The program stores a lot of complicated data that you will put hours and hours of work into, and if you only have one copy and your hard drive breaks, you could lose everything. This has happened before--to people who thought it would never happen to them--and it sucks big time to go through. Don't let it be you.</p> <p>Hydrus's database engine, SQLite, is excellent at keeping data safe, but it cannot work in a faulty environment.

All your images and movies are read-only in hydrus, and there's less worry if they are on a network share with bad locks or a machine that suddenly loses power. The database, however, maintains a live connection, with regular complex writes, and here a hardware failure can lead to corruption (basically the failure scrambles the data that is written, so when you try to boot back up, a small section of the database is incomprehensible garbage).</p> <p>If you do not already have a backup routine for your files, this is a great time to start. I now run a backup every week of all my data so that if my computer blows up or anything else awful happens, I'll at worst have lost a few days' work.

Use FreeFileSync or a similar program to back up the four 'client*.db' files in install_dir/db when the client is not running. Just make sure you have a copy of those files, and then if your main install becomes damaged, we will have a reference to either roll back to or manually restore data from. Even if you lose a bunch of media files in this case, with an intact database we'll be able to schedule recovery of anything with a URL.</p> <p>If you are really short on space, note also that the database files are very compressible. A very large database where the four files add up to 70GB can compress down to 17GB zip with 7zip on default settings. Better compression ratios are possible if you make sure to put all four files in the same archive and turn up the quality. This obviously takes some additional time to do, but if you are really short on space it may be the only way it fits, and if your only backup drive is a slow USB stick, then you might actually save time from not having to transfer the other 53GB! Media files (jpegs, webms, etc...) are generally not very compressible, usually 5% at best, so it is usually not worth trying.</p> <p>It is best to have all four database files. It is generally easy and quick to fix problems if you have a backup of all four. If client.caches.db is missing, you can recover but it might take ten or more hours of CPU work to regenerate. If client.mappings.db is missing, you might be able to recover tags for your local files from a mirror in an intact client.caches.db. However, client.master.db and client.db are the most important. If you lose either of those, or they become too damaged to read and you have no backup, then your database is essentially dead and likely every single archive and view and tag and note and url record you made is lost.

It is not uncommon for users to only keep 15% of what a character sub produces. I do not recommend them for anything but your waifu.</p> <p>Attribute subscriptions like 'blue_eyes' or 'smile' make for terrible subs as the quality is all over the place and you will be inundated by too much content.

As well as making sure you have the exact right query text and that you have everything ever posted (beyond the 100 files deep a sub will typically look), it saves the bulk of the work (and waiting on bandwidth) for the manual downloader, where it belongs. When a new subscription picks up off a freshly completed download queue, its initial subscription sync only takes thirty seconds since its initial URLs are those that were already processed by the manual downloader. I recommend you stack artist searches up in the manual downloader using 'no limit' file limit, and when they are all finished, select them in the list and right-click-&gt;copy queries, which will put the search texts in your clipboard, newline-separated.

Also, if a page with that name already exists, the new files will be appended to it, just like a normal import page! I strongly recommend moving to this once you have several subs going. Make a 'page of pages' called 'subs' and put all your subscription landing pages in there, and then you can check it whenever is convenient.</p> <p>If you discover your subscription workflow tends to be the same for each sub, you can also customise the publication 'label' used. If multiple subs all publish to the 'nsfw subs' label, they will all end up on the same 'nsfw subs' popup button or landing page.

It sounds simple, but unusual situations like 'a file got tagged late, so it inserted deeper than it ideally should in the gallery search' or 'the website changed its URL format completely, help' can cause problems. Subscriptions are automatic systems, so they tend to be a bit more careful and paranoid about problems, lest they burn 10GB on 10,000 unexpected diaperfur images.</p> <p>The initial sync is simple. It does a regular search, stopping if it reaches the 'initial file limit' or the last file in the gallery, whichever comes first. The default initial file sync is 100, which is a great number for almost all situations.</p> <p>Subsequent syncs are more complicated. It ideally 'stops' searching when it reaches files it saw in a previous sync, but if it comes across new files mixed in with the old, it will search a bit deeper. It is not foolproof, and if a file gets tagged very late and ends up a hundred deep in the search, it will probably be missed. There is no good and computationally cheap way at present to resolve this problem, but thankfully it is rare.</p> <p>Remember that an important 'staying sane' philosophy of downloading and subscriptions is to focus on dealing with the 99.5% you have before worrying about the 0.5% you do not.</p> <p>The amount of time between syncs is calculated by the checker options. Based on the timestamps attached to existing urls in the subscription cache (either added time, or the post time as parsed from the url), the sub estimates how long it will be before n new files appear, and then next check is scheduled for then. Unless you know what you are doing, checker options, like file limits, are best left alone. A subscription will naturally adapt its checking speed to the file 'velocity' of the source, and there is usually very little benefit to trying to force a sub to check at a radically different speed.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If you want to force your subs to run at the same time, say every evening, it is easier to just use network-&gt;pause-&gt;subscriptions as a manual master on/off control. The ones that are due will catch up together, the ones that aren't won't waste your time.</p> <p>Remember that subscriptions only keep up with new content. They cannot search backwards in time in order to 'fill out' a search, nor can they fill in gaps. Do not change the file limits or check times to try to make this happen. If you want to ensure complete sync with all existing content for a particular search, use the manual downloader.</p> <p>In practice, most subs only need to check the first page of a gallery since only the first two or three urls are new.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started_subscriptions.html#periodic_file_limit","title":"periodic file limit exceeded","text":"<p>If, during a regular sync, the sub keeps finding new URLs, never hitting a block of already-seen URLs, it will stop upon hitting its 'periodic file limit', which is also usually 100.

There are two typical causes:</p> <ul> <li>A user suddenly posted a large number of files to the site for that query. This sometimes happens with CG gallery spam.</li> <li>The website changed their URL format.</li> </ul> <p>The first case is a natural accident of statistics. The subscription now has a 'gap' in its sync. The popup should have a button that will spawn a new one-time gallery downloader page (with a 5x file limit) that should automatically fill the gap in.</p> <p>The second case is a safety stopgap for hydrus. If a site decides to have <code>/post/123456</code> style URLs instead of <code>post.php?id=123456</code> style, hydrus will suddenly see those as entirely 'new' URLs. It could also be because of an updated downloader, which pulls URLs in API format or similar. This is again thankfully quite rare, but it triggers several problems--the associated downloader usually breaks, as it does not yet recognise those new URLs, and all your subs for that site will parse through and hit the periodic limit for every query. When this happens, you'll usually get several periodic limit popups at once, and you may need to update your downloader. If you know the person who wrote the original downloader, they'll likely want to know about the problem, or may already have a fix sorted.

For most general purposes, normal users can rest assured that their activity on a repository like the Public Tag Repository (PTR) is effectively completely anonymous.</p> <p>You need an account to connect, but all that really means serverside is a random number with a random passcode. Your client tells nothing more to the server than the exact content you upload to it (e.g. tag mappings, which are a tag+file_hash pair).

Even in the case where you cannot trust the server you are talking to, hydrus should be fairly robust, simply because the client does not say much to the server, nor that often.

I don't put training wheels or limiters on the software either, so if you search for 300,000 files, the client will try to fetch that many.</p> <p>Furthermore, I am just one unprofessional guy dealing with a lot of legacy code from when I was even worse at programming. I am always working to reduce lag and other inconveniences, and improve UI feedback when many things are going on, but there is still a lot for me to do.</p> <p>In general, the client works best on snappy computers with low-latency hard drives where it does not have to constantly compete with other CPU- or HDD- heavy programs. Running hydrus on your games computer is no problem at all, but if you leave the client on all the time, then make sure under the options it is set not to do idle work while your CPU is busy, so your games can run freely. Similarly, if you run two clients on the same computer, you should have them set to work at different times, because if they both try to process 500,000 tags at once on the same hard drive, they will each slow to a crawl.</p> <p>If you run on an HDD, keeping it defragged is very important, and good practice for all your programs anyway.

Reducing it may be tempting for a server of just a small group of friends, since it means you'll see changes with lower latency, but don't go crazy. I would never dip below 10,000 seconds, and after some weeks the ratio between what is already on the server and what was added in the past day becomes far less important.</p>"},{"location":"server.html#backing_up","title":"btw, how to backup a repo's db","text":"<p>All of a server's files and options are stored in its accompanying .db file and respective subdirectories, which are created on first startup (just like with the client). To backup or restore, you have two options:</p> <ul> <li>Shut down the server, copy the database files and directories, then restart it. This is the only way, currently, to restore a db.</li> <li>In the client, hit admin-&gt;your server-&gt;make a backup. This will lock the db server-side while it makes a copy of everything server-related to <code>server_install_dir/db/server_backup</code>. When the operation is complete, you can ftp/batch-copy/whatever the server_backup folder wherever you like.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"server.html#hell","title":"OMG EVERYTHING WENT WRONG","text":"<p>If you get to a point where you can no longer boot the repository, try running SQLite Studio and opening server.db.

I'm amazed and grateful that anyone wants to use my software and share tags with others. I enjoy the feedback and work, and I hope to keep putting completely free weekly releases out as long as there is more to do.</p> <p>That said, as I have developed the software, several users have kindly offered to contribute money, either as thanks for a specific feature or just in general. I kept putting the thought off, but I eventually got over my hesitance and set something up.</p> <p>I find the tactics of most internet fundraising very distasteful, especially when they promise something they then fail to deliver. I much prefer the 'if you like me and would like to contribute, then please do, meanwhile I'll keep doing what I do' model. I support several 'put out regular free content' creators on Patreon in this way, and I get a lot out of it, even though I have no direct reward beyond the knowledge that I helped some people do something neat.</p> <p>If you feel the same way about my work, I've set up a simple Patreon page here.

That means that one instance of hydrus do not know what another is doing. This is great if you want different installations for different things.</li> <li>Some of the input fields behave a little wonky. Though that may just be standard Hydrus behavior.</li> <li>Mostly everything else works fine. I was able to connect to the test server and view there. Only thing I need to test is the ability to host a server.</li> </ul> <p>Installation process:</p> <ol> <li>Get a standard Wine installation.</li> <li>Download the latest hydrus .zip file.</li> <li>Unpack it with your chosen zip file opener, in the chosen folder.
