# contact and links

I welcome all your bug reports, questions, ideas, and comments. It is always interesting to see how other people are using my software and what they generally think of it. Most of the changes every week are suggested by users.

You can contact me by email, twitter, discord, or the release threads on 8chan or Endchan--I do not mind which. Please know that I have difficulty with social media, and while I try to reply to all messages, it sometimes takes me a while to catch up.

If you need it, [here's](assets/hydev_key/Hydrus%20Network%20Developer_76249F053212133C_public.asc) my public GPG key.

The [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/issues) was turned off for some time, as it did not fit my workflow and I could not keep up, but it is now running again, managed by a team of volunteer users. Please feel free to submit feature requests there if you are comfortable with Github. I am not socially active on Github, please do not ping me there.

I am on the discord on Saturday afternoon, USA time, if you would like to talk live, and briefly on Wednesday after I put the release out. If that is not a good time for you, please leave me a DM and I will get to you when I can. There are also plenty of other hydrus users who idle who can help with support questions.

I delete all tweets and resolved email conversations after three months. So, if you think you are waiting for a reply, or I said I was going to work on something you care about and seem to have forgotten, please do nudge me.

I am always overwhelmed by work and behind on my messages. This is not to say that I do not enjoy just hanging out or talking about possible new features, but forgive me if some work takes longer than expected or if I cannot get to a particular idea quickly. In the same way, if you encounter actual traceback-raising errors or crashes, there is only one guy to fix it, so I prefer to know ASAP so I can prioritise.

I work by myself because I have acute difficulty working with others. Please do not spontaneously write long design documents or prepare other work for me--I find it more stressful than helpful, every time, and I won't give it the attention it deserves. If you would like to contribute time to hydrus, the user projects like the downloader repository and wiki help guides always have things to do.
