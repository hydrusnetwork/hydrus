# API documentation

## Library modules created by hydrus users

* [Hydrus API](https://gitlab.com/cryzed/hydrus-api): A python module that talks to the API.
* [hydrus.js](https://github.com/cravxx/hydrus.js): A node.js module that talks to the API.
* [more projects on github](https://github.com/stars/hydrusnetwork/lists/hydrus-related-projects)

## API

In general, the API deals with standard UTF-8 JSON. POST requests and 200 OK responses are generally going to be a JSON 'Object' with variable names as keys and values obviously as values. There are examples throughout this document. For GET requests, everything is in standard GET parameters, but some variables are complicated and will need to be JSON-encoded and then URL-encoded. An example would be the 'tags' parameter on [GET /get\_files/search\_files](#get_files_search_files), which is a list of strings. Since GET http URLs have limits on what characters are allowed, but hydrus tags can have all sorts of characters, you'll be doing this:

*   Your list of tags:
    
    ```
    [ 'character:samus aran', 'creator:青い桜', 'system:height > 2000' ]
    ```
    
*   JSON-encoded:
    
    ```json
    ["character:samus aran", "creator:\\u9752\\u3044\\u685c", "system:height > 2000"]
    ```
    
*   Then URL-encoded:
    
    ```
    %5B%22character%3Asamus%20aran%22%2C%20%22creator%3A%5Cu9752%5Cu3044%5Cu685c%22%2C%20%22system%3Aheight%20%3E%202000%22%5D
    ```
    
*   In python, converting your tag list to the URL-encoded string would be:
    
    ```
    urllib.parse.quote( json.dumps( tag_list ), safe = '' )
    ```
    
*   Full URL path example:
    
    ```
    /get_files/search_files?file_sort_type=6&file_sort_asc=false&tags=%5B%22character%3Asamus%20aran%22%2C%20%22creator%3A%5Cu9752%5Cu3044%5Cu685c%22%2C%20%22system%3Aheight%20%3E%202000%22%5D
    ```
    

The API returns JSON for everything except actual file/thumbnail requests. Every JSON response includes the `version` of the Client API and `hydrus_version` of the Client hosting it (for brevity, these values are not included in the example responses in this help). For errors, you'll typically get 400 for a missing/invalid parameter, 401/403/419 for missing/insufficient/expired access, and 500 for a real deal serverside error.

!!! note
    For any request sent to the API, the total size of the initial request line (this includes the URL and any parameters) and the headers must not be larger than 2 megabytes.
    Exceeding this limit will cause the request to fail. Make sure to use pagination if you are passing very large JSON arrays as parameters in a GET request.
    

## CBOR

The API now tentatively supports CBOR, which is basically 'byte JSON'. If you are in a lower level language or need to do a lot of heavy work quickly, try it out!

To send CBOR, for POST put Content-Type `application/cbor` in your request header instead of `application/json`, and for GET just add a `cbor=1` parameter to the URL string. Use CBOR to encode any parameters that you would previously put in JSON:

For POST requests, just print the pure bytes in the body, like this:

```
cbor2.dumps( arg_dict )
```

For GET, encode the parameter value in base64, like this:

```
base64.urlsafe_b64encode( cbor2.dumps( argument ) )
```
-or-
```
str( base64.urlsafe_b64encode( cbor2.dumps( argument ) ), 'ascii' )
```

If you send CBOR, the client will return CBOR. If you want to send CBOR and get JSON back, or _vice versa_ (or you are uploading a file and can't set CBOR Content-Type), send the Accept request header, like so:

```
Accept: application/cbor
Accept: application/json
```

If the client does not support CBOR, you'll get 406.

## Access and permissions

The client gives access to its API through different 'access keys', which are the typical random 64-character hex used in many other places across hydrus. Each guarantees different permissions such as handling files or tags. Most of the time, a user will provide full access, but do not assume this. If a access key header or parameter is not provided, you will get 401, and all insufficient permission problems will return 403 with appropriate error text.

Access is required for every request. You can provide this as an http header, like so:

```
Hydrus-Client-API-Access-Key : 0150d9c4f6a6d2082534a997f4588dcf0c56dffe1d03ffbf98472236112236ae
```    

Or you can include it in the normal parameters of any request (except _POST /add\_files/add\_file_, which uses the entire POST body for the file's bytes).

For GET, this means including it into the URL parameters:

```
/get_files/thumbnail?file_id=452158&Hydrus-Client-API-Access-Key=0150d9c4f6a6d2082534a997f4588dcf0c56dffe1d03ffbf98472236112236ae
```    

For POST, this means in the JSON body parameters, like so:

```
{
    "hash_id" : 123456,
    "Hydrus-Client-API-Access-Key" : "0150d9c4f6a6d2082534a997f4588dcf0c56dffe1d03ffbf98472236112236ae"
}
```

There is also a simple 'session' system, where you can get a temporary key that gives the same access without having to include the permanent access key in every request. You can fetch a session key with the [/session_key](#session_key) command and thereafter use it just as you would an access key, just with _Hydrus-Client-API-Session-Key_ instead.

Session keys will expire if they are not used within 24 hours, or if the client is restarted, or if the underlying access key is deleted. An invalid/expired session key will give a **419** result with an appropriate error text.

Bear in mind the Client API is still under construction. Setting up the Client API to be accessible across the internet requires technical experience to be convenient. HTTPS is available for encrypted comms, but the default certificate is self-signed (which basically means an eavesdropper can't see through it, but your ISP/government could if they decided to target you). If you have your own domain to host from and an SSL cert, you can replace them and it'll use them instead (check the db directory for client.crt and client.key). Otherwise, be careful about transmitting sensitive content outside of your localhost/network.

## Common Complex Parameters

### **files** { id="parameters_files" }

If you need to refer to some files, you can use any of the following:

Arguments:
:   
    *   `file_id`: (selective, a numerical file id)
    *   `file_ids`: (selective, a list of numerical file ids)
    *   `hash`: (selective, a hexadecimal SHA256 hash)
    *   `hashes`: (selective, a list of hexadecimal SHA256 hashes)

In GET requests, make sure any list is percent-encoded JSON. Your `[1,2,3]` becomes `urllib.parse.quote( json.dumps( [1,2,3] ), safe = '' )`, and thus `file_ids=%5B1%2C%202%2C%203%5D`.

### **file domain** { id="parameters_file_domain" }

When you are searching, you may want to specify a particular file domain. Most of the time, you'll want to just set `file_service_key`, but this can get complex:

Arguments:
:   
    *   `file_service_key`: (optional, selective A, hexadecimal, the file domain on which to search)
    *   `file_service_keys`: (optional, selective A, list of hexadecimals, the union of file domains on which to search)
    *   `deleted_file_service_key`: (optional, selective B, hexadecimal, the 'deleted from this file domain' on which to search)
    *   `deleted_file_service_keys`: (optional, selective B, list of hexadecimals, the union of 'deleted from this file domain' on which to search)

The service keys are as in [/get\_services](#get_services).

Hydrus supports two concepts here:

* Searching over a UNION of subdomains. If the user has several local file domains, e.g. 'favourites', 'personal', 'sfw', and 'nsfw', they might like to search two of them at once.
* Searching deleted files of subdomains. You can specifically, and quickly, search the files that have been deleted from somewhere.

You can play around with this yourself by clicking 'multiple locations' in the client with _help->advanced mode_ on.

In extreme edge cases, these two can be mixed by populating both A and B selective, making a larger union of both current and deleted file records.

Please note that unions can be very very computationally expensive. If you can achieve what you want with a single file_service_key, two queries in a row with different service keys, or an umbrella like `all my files` or `all local files`, please do. Otherwise, let me know what is running slow and I'll have a look at it.

'deleted from all local files' includes all files that have been physically deleted (i.e. deleted from the trash) and not available any more for fetch file/thumbnail requests. 'deleted from all my files' includes all of those physically deleted files _and_ the trash. If a file is deleted with the special 'do not leave a deletion record' command, then it won't show up in a 'deleted from file domain' search!

'all known files' is a tricky domain. It converts much of the search tech to ignore where files actually are and look at the accompanying tag domain (e.g. all the files that have been tagged), and can sometimes be very expensive.

Also, if you have the option to set both file and tag domains, you cannot enter 'all known files'/'all known tags'. It is too complicated to support, sorry!

### **legacy service_name parameters** { id="legacy_service_name_parameters" }

The Client API used to respond to name-based service identifiers, for instance using 'my tags' instead of something like '6c6f63616c2074616773'. Service names can change, and they aren't _strictly_ unique either, so I have moved away from them, but there is some soft legacy support.

The client will attempt to convert any of these to their 'service_key(s)' equivalents:

* file_service_name
* tag_service_name
* service_names_to_tags
* service_names_to_actions_to_tags
* service_names_to_additional_tags

But I strongly encourage you to move away from them as soon as reasonably possible. Look up the service keys you need with [/get\_service](#get_service) or [/get\_services](#get_services).

If you have a clever script/program that does many things, then hit up [/get\_services](#get_services) on session initialisation and cache an internal map of key_to_name for the labels to use when you present services to the user.

Also, note that all users can now copy their service keys from _review services_.

## The Services Object { id="services_object" }

Hydrus manages its different available domains and actions with what it calls _services_. If you are a regular user of the program, you will know about _review services_ and _manage services_. The Client API needs to refer to services, either to accept commands from you or to tell you what metadata files have and where.

When it does this, it gives you this structure, typically under a `services` key right off the root node:

```json title="Services Object"
{
  "c6f63616c2074616773" : {
    "name" : "my tags",
    "type": 5,
    "type_pretty" : "local tag service"
  },

    "name" : "trash",
    "type" : 14,
    "type_pretty" : "local trash file domain"
  }
}
```

I hope you recognise some of the information here. But what's that hex key on each section? It is the `service_key`.

All services have these properties:

- `name` - A mutable human-friendly name like 'my tags'. You can use this to present the service to the user--they should recognise it.
- `type` - An integer enum saying whether the service is a local tag service or like/dislike rating service or whatever. This cannot change.
- `service_key` - The true 'id' of the service. It is a string of hex, sometimes just twenty or so characters but in many cases 64 characters. This cannot change, and it is how we will refer to different services.

This `service_key` is important. A user can rename their services, so `name` is not an excellent identifier, and definitely not something you should save to any permanent config file.

If we want to search some files on a particular file and tag domain, we should expect to be saying something like `file_service_key=6c6f63616c2066696c6573` and `tag_service_key=f032e94a38bb9867521a05dc7b189941a9c65c25048911f936fc639be2064a4b` somewhere in the request.

You won't see all of these, but the service `type` enum is:

* 0 - tag repository
* 1 - file repository
* 2 - a local file domain like 'my files'
* 5 - a local tag domain like 'my tags'
* 6 - a 'numerical' rating service with several stars
* 7 - a 'like/dislike' rating service with on/off status
* 10 - all known tags -- a union of all the tag services
* 11 - all known files -- a union of all the file services and files that appear in tag services
* 12 - the local booru -- you can ignore this
* 13 - IPFS
* 14 - trash
* 15 - all local files -- all files on hard disk ('all my files' + updates + trash) 
* 17 - file notes
* 18 - Client API
* 19 - deleted from anywhere -- you can ignore this
* 20 - local updates -- a file domain to store repository update files in
* 21 - all my files -- union of all local file domains
* 22 - a 'inc/dec' rating service with positive integer rating
* 99 - server administration

`type_pretty` is something you can show users. Hydrus uses the same labels in _manage services_ and so on.

Rating services now have some extra data:

- like/dislike and numerical services have `star_shape`, which is one of:
` circle | square | fat star | pentagram star | six point star | eight point star | x shape | square cross | triangle up | triangle down | triangle right | triangle left | diamond | rhombus right | rhombus left | hourglass | pentagon | hexagon | small hexagon | heart | teardrop | crescent moon `
- numerical services have `min_stars` (0 or 1) and `max_stars` (1 to 20)

If you are displaying ratings, don't feel crazy obligated to obey the shape! Show a 4/5, select from a dropdown list, do whatever you like!

If you want to know the services in a client, hit up [/get\_services](#get_services), which simply gives the above. The same structure has recently been added to [/get\_files/file\_metadata](#get_files_file_metadata) for convenience, since that refers to many different services when it is talking about file locations and ratings and so on.

Note: If you need to do some quick testing, you should be able to copy the `service_key` of any service by hitting the 'copy service key' button in _review services_.

## Current Deleted Pending Petitioned { id="CDPP" }

The content storage and update pipeline systems in hydrus consider content (e.g. 'on file service x, file y exists', 'on tag service x, file y has tag z', or 'on rating service x, file y has rating z') as existing within a blend of four states:

* **Current** - The content exists on the service.
* **Deleted** - The content has been removed from on the service.
* **Pending** - The content is queued to be added to the service.
* **Petitioned** - The content is queued to be removed from the service.

Where content that has never touched the service has a default 'null status' of no state at all.

Content may be in two categories at once--for instance, any Petitioned data is always also Current--but some states are mutually exclusive: Current data cannot also be Deleted.

Let's examine this more carefully specifically. Current, Deleted, and Pending may exist on their own, and Deleted and Pending may exist simultaneously. Read this horizontally to vertically, such that 'Content that is Current may also be Petitioned' while 'Content that is Petitioned must also be Current':

|                | Current | Deleted | Pending | Petitioned |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Current**    | -       | Never   | Never   | May        |
| **Deleted**    | Never   | -       | May     | Never      |
| **Pending**    | Never   | May     | -       | Never      |
| **Petitioned** | Must    | Never   | Never   | -          |

Local services have no concept of pending or petitioned, so they generally just have 'add x'/'delete x' verbs to convert content between current and deleted. Remote services like the PTR have a queue of pending changes waiting to be committed by the user to the server, so in these cases I will expose to you the full suite of 'pend x'/'petition x'/'rescind pend x'/'rescind petition x'. Although you might somewhere be able to 'pend'/'petition' content to a local service, these 'pending' changes will be committed instantly so they are synonymous with add/delete.

* When an 'add' is committed, the data is removed from the deleted record and added to the current record.
* When a 'delete' is committed, the data is removed from the current record and added to the deleted record.
* When a 'pend' is committed, the data is removed from the deleted record and added to the current record. (It is also deleted from the pending record!)
* When a 'petition' is committed, the data is removed from the current record and added to the deleted record. (It is also deleted from the petitioned record!)
* When a 'rescind pend' is committed, the data is removed from the pending record.
* When a 'rescind petition' is committed, the data is removed from the petitioned record.

Let's look at where the verbs make sense. Again, horizontal, so 'Content that is Current can receive a Petition command':

|                | Add/Pend                         | Delete/Petition                  | Rescind Pend | Rescind Petition |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **No state**   | May                              | May                              | -            | -                |
| **Current**    | -                                | May                              | -            | -                |
| **Deleted**    | _May_                            | -                                | -            | -                |
| **Pending**    | May overwrite an existing reason | -                                | May          | -                |
| **Petitioned** | -                                | May overwrite an existing reason | -            | May              |

In hydrus, anything in the content update pipeline that _doesn't_ make sense, here a '-', tends to result in an errorless no-op, so you might not care to do too much filtering on your end of things if you don't need to--don't worry about deleting something twice.

Note that content that does not yet exist _can_ be pre-emptively petitioned/deleted. A couple of advanced cases enjoy this capability, for instance when you are syncing delete records from one client to another.

Also, it is often the case that content that is recorded as deleted is more difficult to re-add/re-pend. You might need to be a janitor to re-pend something, or, for this API, set some `override_previously_deleted_mappings` parameter. This is by design and helps you to stop automatically re-adding something that the user spent slow human time deciding to delete.

## Access Management

### **GET `/api_version`** { id="api_version" }

_Gets the current API version. This increments every time I alter the API._

Restricted access: NO.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments: n/a
    
Response:
: Some simple JSON describing the current api version (and hydrus client version, if you are interested).
: Note that this is not very useful any more, for two reasons:

: 1. The 'Server' header of every response (and a duplicated 'Hydrus-Server' one, if you have a complicated proxy situation that overwrites 'Server') are now in the form "client api/{client_api_version} ({software_version})", e.g. "client api/32 (497)".
: 2. **Every JSON response explicitly includes this now.**

```json title="Example response"
{
  "version" : 17,
  "hydrus_version" : 441
}
```

### **GET `/request_new_permissions`** { id="request_new_permissions" }

_Register a new external program with the client. This requires the 'add from api request' mini-dialog under_ services->review services _to be open, otherwise it will 403._

Restricted access: NO.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments:
    
:   *   `name`: (descriptive name of your access)
    *   `permits_everything`: (selective, bool, whether to permit all tasks now and in future)
    *   `basic_permissions`: Selective. A JSON-encoded list of numerical permission identifiers you want to request.
        
        The permissions are currently:

        *   0 - Import and Edit URLs
        *   1 - Import and Delete Files
        *   2 - Edit File Tags
        *   3 - Search for and Fetch Files
        *   4 - Manage Pages
        *   5 - Manage Cookies and Headers
        *   6 - Manage Database
        *   7 - Edit File Notes
        *   8 - Edit File Relationships
        *   9 - Edit File Ratings
        *   10 - Manage Popups
        *   11 - Edit File Times
        *   12 - Commit Pending
        *   13 - See Local Paths


``` title="Example request"
/request_new_permissions?name=migrator&permit_everything=true
```

``` title="Example request (for permissions [0,1])"
/request_new_permissions?name=my%20import%20script&basic_permissions=%5B0%2C1%5D
```

Response: 
:   Some JSON with your access key, which is 64 characters of hex. This will not be valid until the user approves the request in the client ui.
```json title="Example response"
{
    "access_key" : "73c9ab12751dcf3368f028d3abbe1d8e2a3a48d0de25e64f3a8f00f3a1424c57"
}
```     

The `permits_everything` overrules all the individual permissions and will encompass any new permissions added in future. It is a convenient catch-all for local-only services where you are running things yourself or the user otherwise implicitly trusts you.

### **GET `/session_key`** { id="session_key" }

_Get a new session key._

Restricted access: YES. No permissions required.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments: n/a
    
Response: 
:   Some JSON with a new session key in hex.

}
```
        
!!! note
    Note that the access you provide to get a new session key **can** be a session key, if that happens to be useful. As long as you have some kind of access, you can generate a new session key.
    
    A session key expires after 24 hours of inactivity, whenever the client restarts, or if the underlying access key is deleted. A request on an expired session key returns 419.
    

### **GET `/verify_access_key`** { id="verify_access_key" }

_Check your access key is valid._

Restricted access: YES. No permissions required.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments: n/a
    
Response: 
:   401/403/419 and some error text if the provided access/session key is invalid, otherwise some JSON with basic permission info. 

```json title="Example response"
{
  "name" : "autotagger",
  "permits_everything" : false,
  "basic_permissions" : [0, 1, 3],
  "human_description" : "API Permissions (autotagger): add tags to files, import files, search for files: Can search: only autotag this"
}
```

### **GET `/get_service`** { id="get_service" }

_Ask the client about a specific service._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. At least one of Add Files, Add Tags, Manage Pages, or Search Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments:
:       
    *   `service_name`: (selective, string, the name of the service)
    *   `service_key`: (selective, hex string, the service key of the service)

Example requests:
:   
    ```title="Example requests"
    /get_service?service_name=my%20tags
    /get_service?service_key=6c6f63616c2074616773
    ```

Response: 
:   Some JSON about the service. A similar format as [/get\_services](#get_services) and [The Services Object](#services_object).
```json title="Example response"
{
  "service" : {
    "name" : "my tags",
    "service_key" : "6c6f63616c2074616773",
    "type" : 5,
    "type_pretty" : "local tag service"
  }
}
```

If the service does not exist, this gives 404. It is very unlikely but edge-case possible that two services will have the same name, in this case you'll get the pseudorandom first.

It will only respond to services in the /get_services list. I will expand the available types in future as we add ratings etc... to the Client API.

### **GET `/get_services`** { id="get_services" }

_Ask the client about its services._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. At least one of Add Files, Add Tags, Manage Pages, or Search Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments: n/a
    
Response: 
:   Some JSON listing the client's services.

```json title="Example response"
{
  "services" : "The Services Object"
}
```  

This now primarily uses [The Services Object](#services_object).

!!! note
    If you do the request and look at the actual response, you will see a lot more data under different keys--this is deprecated, and will be deleted in 2024. If you use the old structure, please move over!

## Importing and Deleting Files

### **POST `/add_files/add_file`** { id="add_files_add_file" }

_Tell the client to import a file._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Import Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   - Content-Type: `application/json` (if sending path), `application/octet-stream` (if sending file)

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    * `path`: (the path you want to import)
    * `delete_after_successful_import`: (optional, defaults to `false`, sets to delete the source file on a 'successful' or 'already in db' result)
    * [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, local file domain(s) only, defaults to your "quiet" file import options's destination)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "path" : "E:\\to_import\\ayanami.jpg"
}
```

If you include a [file domain](#parameters_file_domain), it can only include 'local' file domains (by default on a new client this would just be "my files"), but you can send multiple to import to more than one location at once. Asking to import to 'all local files', 'all my files', 'trash', 'repository updates', or a file repository/ipfs will give you 400.

Arguments (as bytes): 
:   
    You can alternately just send the file's raw bytes as the entire POST body. In this case, you cannot send any other parameters, so you will be left with the default import file domain.

Response: 
:   Some JSON with the import result. Please note that file imports for large files may take several seconds, and longer if the client is busy doing other db work, so make sure your request is willing to wait that long for the response.
```json title="Example response"
{
  "status" : 1,
  "hash" : "29a15ad0c035c0a0e86e2591660207db64b10777ced76565a695102a481c3dd1",
  "note" : ""
}
```
    
    `status` is:
    
    *   1 - File was successfully imported
    *   2 - File already in database
    *   3 - File previously deleted
    *   4 - File failed to import
    *   7 - File vetoed
    
    A file 'veto' is caused by the file import options (which in this case is the 'quiet' set under the client's _options->importing_) stopping the file due to its resolution or minimum file size rules, etc...
    
    'hash' is the file's SHA256 hash in hexadecimal, and 'note' is any additional human-readable text appropriate to the file status that you may recognise from hydrus's normal import workflow. For an outright import error, it will be a summary of the exception that you can present to the user, and a new field `traceback` will have the full trace for debugging purposes.
     

### **POST `/add_files/delete_files`** { id="add_files_delete_files" }

_Tell the client to send files to the trash._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Import Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
*   `Content-Type`: `application/json`

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)
*   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, defaults to _all my files_)
*   `reason`: (optional, string, the reason attached to the delete action)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "hash" : "78f92ba4a786225ee2a1236efa6b7dc81dd729faf4af99f96f3e20bad6d8b538"
}
```
    
Response:
:   200 and no content.

If you specify a file service, the file will only be deleted from that location. Only local file domains are allowed (so you can't delete from a file repository or unpin from ipfs yet), or the umbrella `all my files` and `all local files` domains. It defaults to `all my files`, which will delete from all local services (i.e. force sending to trash). Sending `all local files` on a file already in the trash will trigger a physical file delete. 

### **POST `/add_files/undelete_files`** { id="add_files_undelete_files" }

_Tell the client to restore files that were previously deleted to their old file service(s)._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Import Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
*   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)
*   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, defaults to _all my files_)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "hash" : "78f92ba4a786225ee2a1236efa6b7dc81dd729faf4af99f96f3e20bad6d8b538"
}
```

Response: 
:   200 and no content.

This is the reverse of a delete_files--restoring files back to where they came from. If you specify a file service, the files will only be undeleted to there (if they have a delete record, otherwise this is nullipotent). The default, 'all my files', undeletes to all local file services for which there are deletion records.

This operation will only occur on files that are currently in your file store (i.e. in 'all local files', and maybe, but not necessarily, in 'trash'). You cannot 'undelete' something you do not have!

### **POST `/add_files/clear_file_deletion_record`** { id="add_files_clear_file_deletion_record" }

_Tell the client to forget that it once deleted files._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Import Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
*   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "hash" : "78f92ba4a786225ee2a1236efa6b7dc81dd729faf4af99f96f3e20bad6d8b538"
}
```

Response: 
:   200 and no content.

This is the same as the advanced deletion option of the same basic name. It will erase the record that a file has been physically deleted (i.e. it only applies to deletion records in the 'all local files' domain). A file that no longer has a 'all local files' deletion record will pass a 'exclude previously deleted files' check in a _file import options_.


### **POST `/add_files/migrate_files`** { id="add_files_migrate_files" }

_Copy files from one local file domain to another._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Import Files permission needed.

Required Headers:
:   
*   `Content-Type`: `application/json`

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)
*   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "hash" : "78f92ba4a786225ee2a1236efa6b7dc81dd729faf4af99f96f3e20bad6d8b538",
  "file_service_key" : "572ff2bd34857c0b3210b967a5a40cb338ca4c5747f2218d4041ddf8b6d077f1"
}
```

Response:
:   200 and no content.

This is only appropriate if the user has multiple local file services. It does the same as the media _files->add to->domain_ menu action. If the files are originally in local file domain A, and you say to add to B, then afterwards they will be in both A and B. You can say 'B and C' to add to multiple domains at once, if needed. The action is idempotent and will not overwrite 'already in' files with fresh timestamps or anything.

If you need to do a 'move' migrate, then please follow this command with a delete from wherever you need to remove from.

If you try to add non-local files (specifically, files that are not in 'all my files'), or migrate to a file domain that is not a local file domain, then this will 400!

### **POST `/add_files/archive_files`** { id="add_files_archive_files" }

_Tell the client to archive inboxed files._

Restricted access: 
:  YES. Import Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
*   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:  
*   [files](#parameters_files)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "hash" : "78f92ba4a786225ee2a1236efa6b7dc81dd729faf4af99f96f3e20bad6d8b538"
}
```
    
Response: 
:   200 and no content.
    
This puts files in the 'archive', taking them out of the inbox. It only has meaning for files currently in 'my files' or 'trash'. There is no error if any files do not currently exist or are already in the archive.
    

### **POST `/add_files/unarchive_files`** { id="add_files_unarchive_files" }

_Tell the client re-inbox archived files._

Restricted access: 
:  YES. Import Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
*   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:  
*   [files](#parameters_files)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "hash" : "78f92ba4a786225ee2a1236efa6b7dc81dd729faf4af99f96f3e20bad6d8b538"
}
```
    
Response: 
:   200 and no content.
    
This puts files back in the inbox, taking them out of the archive. It only has meaning for files currently in 'my files' or 'trash'. There is no error if any files do not currently exist or are already in the inbox.
    

### **POST `/add_files/generate_hashes`** { id="add_files_generate_hashes" }

_Generate hashes for an arbitrary file._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Import Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   - Content-Type: `application/json` (if sending path), `application/octet-stream` (if sending file)

Arguments (in JSON):
:   - `path`: (the path you want to import)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "path" : "E:\\to_import\\ayanami.jpg"
}
```

Arguments (as bytes): 
:   You can alternately just send the file's bytes as the POST body.
    
Response: 
:   Some JSON with the hashes of the file
```json title="Example response"
{
  "hash": "7de421a3f9be871a7037cca8286b149a31aecb6719268a94188d76c389fa140c",
  "perceptual_hashes": [
    "b44dc7b24dcb381c"
  ],
  "pixel_hash": "c7bf20e5c4b8a524c2c3e3af2737e26975d09cba2b3b8b76341c4c69b196da4e",
}
```

    - `hash` is the sha256 hash of the submitted file.
    - `perceptual_hashes` is a list of perceptual hashes for the file.
    - `pixel_hash` is the sha256 hash of the pixel data of the rendered image.

`hash` will always be returned for any file, the others will only be returned for filetypes they can be generated for.

## Importing and Editing URLs

### **GET `/add_urls/get_url_files`** { id="add_urls_get_url_files" }

_Ask the client about an URL's files._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Import URLs permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments:
:       
    *   `url`: (the url you want to ask about)
    *   `doublecheck_file_system`: true or false (optional, defaults False)

Example request:
:   for URL `http://safebooru.org/index.php?page=post&s=view&id=2753608`:
    ```
    /add_urls/get_url_files?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsafebooru.org%2Findex.php%3Fpage%3Dpost%26s%3Dview%26id%3D2753608
    ```

Response: 
:   Some JSON which files are known to be mapped to that URL. Note this needs a database hit, so it may be delayed if the client is otherwise busy. Don't rely on this to always be fast. 
```json title="Example response"
{
  "normalised_url" : "https://somebooru.org/index.php?id=123456&page=post&s=view",
  "url_file_statuses" : [
    {
      "status" : 2,
      "hash" : "529af82eee3660008a51823ee4ca0c40d1b4d59b6e2f7418e8b23f2d9c01b1fb",
      "note" : "url recognised: Imported at 2015/10/18 10:58:01, which was 3 years 4 months ago (before this check)."
    }
  ]
}
```

The `url_file_statuses` is a list of zero-to-n JSON Objects, each representing a file match the client found in its database for the URL. Typically, it will be of length 0 (for as-yet-unvisited URLs or Gallery/Watchable URLs that are not attached to files) or 1, but sometimes multiple files are given the same URL (sometimes by mistaken misattribution, sometimes by design, such as pixiv manga pages). Handling n files per URL is a pain but an unavoidable issue you should account for.

`status` mas the same mapping as for `/add_files/add_file`, but the possible results are different:

  *   0 - File not in database, ready for import (you will only see this very rarely--usually in this case you will just get no matches)
  *   2 - File already in database
  *   3 - File previously deleted

`hash` is the file's SHA256 hash in hexadecimal, and 'note' is some occasional additional human-readable text you may recognise from hydrus's normal import workflow.

If you set `doublecheck_file_system` to `true`, then any result that is 'already in db' (2) will be double-checked against the actual file system. This check happens on any normal file import process, just to check for and fix missing files (if the file is missing, the status becomes 0--new), but the check can take more than a few milliseconds on an HDD or a network drive, so the default behaviour, assuming you mostly just want to spam for 'seen this before' file statuses, is to not do it. 

### **GET `/add_urls/get_url_info`** { id="add_urls_get_url_info" }

_Ask the client for information about a URL._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Import URLs permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments:
:   
    *   `url`: (the url you want to ask about)

Example request:
:   for URL `https://someimageboard.org/cool/thread/123456/robots`:
    ```
    /add_urls/get_url_info?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomeimageboard.org%2Fcool%2Fthread%2F123456%2Frobots
    ```
    
Response: 
:   Some JSON describing what the client thinks of the URL.
```json title="Example response"
{
  "request_url" : "https://someimageboard.org/cool/thread/123456.json",
  "normalised_url" : "https://someimageboard.org/cool/thread/123456",
  "url_type" : 4,
  "url_type_string" : "watchable url",
  "match_name" : "8chan thread",
  "can_parse" : true
}
```

    The url types are currently:
    
    *   0 - Post URL
    *   2 - File URL
    *   3 - Gallery URL
    *   4 - Watchable URL
    *   5 - Unknown URL (i.e. no matching URL Class)
    
    'Unknown' URLs are treated in the client as direct File URLs. Even though the 'File URL' type is available, most file urls do not have a URL Class, so they will appear as Unknown. Adding them to the client will pass them to the URL Downloader as a raw file for download and import.
    
    The `normalised_url` is the fully normalised URL--what is used for comparison and saving to disk.
    
    The `request_url` is either the lighter 'for server' normalised URL, which may include ephemeral token parameters, or, as in the case here, the fully converted API/redirect URL. (When hydrus is asked to check an imageboard thread, it usually doesn't hit the HTML, but the JSON API.)
    

### **POST `/add_urls/add_url`** { id="add_urls_add_url" }

_Tell the client to 'import' a URL. This triggers the exact same routine as drag-and-dropping a text URL onto the main client window._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Import URLs permission needed. Add Tags needed to include tags.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`

Arguments (in JSON):
:    

    *   `url`: (the url you want to add)
    *   `destination_page_key`: (optional page identifier for the page to receive the url)
    *   `destination_page_name`: (optional page name to receive the url)
    *   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, sets where to import the file)
    *   `show_destination_page`: (optional, defaulting to false, controls whether the UI will change pages on add)
    *   `service_keys_to_additional_tags`: (optional, selective, tags to give to any files imported from this url)
    *   `filterable_tags`: (optional tags to be filtered by any tag import options that applies to the URL)

If you specify a `destination_page_name` and an appropriate importer page already exists with that name, that page will be used. Otherwise, a new page with that name will be recreated (and used by subsequent calls with that name). Make sure it that page name is unique (e.g. '/b/ threads', not 'watcher') in your client, or it may not be found.

Alternately, `destination_page_key` defines exactly which page should be used. Bear in mind this page key is only valid to the current session (they are regenerated on client reset or session reload), so you must figure out which one you want using the [/manage\_pages/get\_pages](#manage_pages_get_pages) call. If the correct page_key is not found, or the page it corresponds to is of the incorrect type, the standard page selection/creation rules will apply.

You can set a destination [file domain](#parameters_file_domain), which will select (or, for probably most of your initial requests, create) a download page that has a non-default 'file import options' with the given destination. If you set both a file domain and also a `destination_page_key`, then the page key takes precedence. If you do not set a file domain, then the import uses whatever the page has, like normal; for url import pages, this is probably your "loud" file import options default. 

`show_destination_page` defaults to False to reduce flicker when adding many URLs to different pages quickly. If you turn it on, the client will behave like a URL drag and drop and select the final page the URL ends up on.

`service_keys_to_additional_tags` uses the same data structure as in /add\_tags/add\_tags--service keys to a list of tags to add. You will need 'add tags' permission or this will 403. These tags work exactly as 'additional' tags work in a _tag import options_. They are service specific, and always added unless some advanced tag import options checkbox (like 'only add tags to new files') is set.

filterable_tags works like the tags parsed by a hydrus downloader. It is just a list of strings. They have no inherant service and will be sent to a _tag import options_, if one exists, to decide which tag services get what. This parameter is useful if you are pulling all a URL's tags outside of hydrus and want to have them processed like any other downloader, rather than figuring out service names and namespace filtering on your end. Note that in order for a tag import options to kick in, I think you will have to have a Post URL URL Class hydrus-side set up for the URL so some tag import options (whether that is Class-specific or just the default) can be loaded at import time.

### **POST `/add_urls/associate_url`** { id="add_urls_associate_url" }

_Manage which URLs the client considers to be associated with which files._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Import URLs permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:       
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`


Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   [files](#parameters_files)
    *   `url_to_add`: (optional, selective A, an url you want to associate with the file(s))
    *   `urls_to_add`: (optional, selective A, a list of urls you want to associate with the file(s))
    *   `url_to_delete`: (optional, selective B, an url you want to disassociate from the file(s))
    *   `urls_to_delete`: (optional, selective B, a list of urls you want to disassociate from the file(s))
    *   `normalise_urls`: (optional, default true, only affects the 'add' urls)

The single/multiple arguments work the same--just use whatever is convenient for you.

Unless you really know what you are doing, I strongly recommend you stick to associating URLs with just one single 'hash' at a time. Multiple hashes pointing to the same URL is unusual and frequently unhelpful.

By default, anything you throw at the 'add' side will be normalised nicely, but if you need to add some specific/weird URL text, or you need to add a URI, set `normalise_urls` to `false`. Anything you throw at the 'delete' side will not be normalised, so double-check you are deleting exactly what you mean to via [GET /get\_files/file\_metadata](#get_files_file_metadata) etc.. 

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "url_to_add" : "https://somebooru.org/index.php?id=12345&page=post&s=view",
  "hash" : "529af82eee3660008a51823ee4ca0c40d1b4d59b6e2f7418e8b23f2d9c01b1fb"

:   200 with no content. Like when adding tags, this is safely idempotent--do not worry about re-adding URLs associations that already exist or accidentally trying to delete ones that don't.


## Editing File Tags

### **GET `/add_tags/clean_tags`** { id="add_tags_clean_tags" }

_Ask the client about how it will see certain tags._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Add Tags permission needed.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
*   `tags`: (a list of the tags you want cleaned)

Example request:
:   Given tags `#!json [ " bikini ", "blue    eyes", " character : samus aran ", " :)", "   ", "", "10", "11", "9", "system:wew", "-flower" ]`:
    ```
    /add_tags/clean_tags?tags=%5B%22%20bikini%20%22%2C%20%22blue%20%20%20%20eyes%22%2C%20%22%20character%20%3A%20samus%20aran%20%22%2C%20%22%3A%29%22%2C%20%22%20%20%20%22%2C%20%22%22%2C%20%2210%22%2C%20%2211%22%2C%20%229%22%2C%20%22system%3Awew%22%2C%20%22-flower%22%5D
    ```

Response: 
:  The tags cleaned according to hydrus rules. They will also be in hydrus human-friendly sorting order.
```json title="Example response"
{
  "tags" : ["9", "10", "11", " ::)", "bikini", "blue eyes", "character:samus aran", "flower", "wew"]
}
```

    Mostly, hydrus simply trims excess whitespace, but the other examples are rare issues you might run into. 'system' is an invalid namespace, tags cannot be prefixed with hyphens, and any tag starting with ':' is secretly dealt with internally as "\[no namespace\]:\[colon-prefixed-subtag\]". Again, you probably won't run into these, but if you see a mismatch somewhere and want to figure it out, or just want to sort some numbered tags, you might like to try this.
    

### **GET `/add_tags/get_siblings_and_parents`** { id="add_tags_get_siblings_and_parents" }

_Ask the client about tags' sibling and parent relationships._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Add Tags permission needed.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
*   `tags`: (a list of the tags you want info on)

Example request:
:   Given tags `#!json [ "blue eyes", "samus aran" ]`:
    ```
    /add_tags/get_siblings_and_parents?tags=%5B%22blue%20eyes%22%2C%20%22samus%20aran%22%5D
    ```

Response: 
:  An Object showing all the display relationships for each tag on each service. Also [The Services Object](#services_object).

      }
    }
  }
}
```
    
    This data is essentially how mappings in the `storage` `tag_display_type` become `display`.
    
    The hex keys are the service keys, which you will have seen elsewhere, like [GET /get\_files/file\_metadata](#get_files_file_metadata). Note that there is no concept of 'all known tags' here. If a tag is in 'my tags', it follows the rules of 'my tags', and then all the services' display tags are merged into the 'all known tags' pool for user display.
    
    !!! warning "Tag Relationships Apply In A Complicated Way"
        There are two caveats to this data:  
        
        1. The siblings and parents here are not just what is in _tags->manage tag siblings/parents_, they are the final computed combination of rules as set in _tags->manage where tag siblings and parents apply_. The data given here is not guaranteed to be useful for editing siblings and parents on a particular service. That data, which is currently pair-based, will appear in a different API request in future.
        2. This is what is _actually processed, right now,_ for those user preferences, as per _tags->sibling/parent sync->review current sync_. It reflects what they currently see in the UI. If the user still has pending sync work, this computation will change in future, perhaps radically (e.g. if they just removed the whole PTR ruleset two minutes ago), as will the rest of the "display" domain. The results may be funky while a user is in the midst of syncing, but these values are fine for most purposes. In the short term, you can broadly assume that the rules here very closely align with what you see in a recent file metadata call that pulls storage vs display mappings. If you want to decorate an autocomplete results call with sibling or parent data, this data is good for that.
    
    - `ideal_tag` is how the tag appears in normal display to the user.
    - `siblings` is every tag that will show as the `ideal_tag`, including the `ideal_tag` itself.
    - `descendants` is every child (and recursive grandchild, great-grandchild...) that implies the `ideal_tag`.
    - `ancestors` is every parent (and recursive grandparent, great-grandparent...) that our tag implies.
    
    Every descendant and ancestor is an `ideal_tag` itself that may have its own siblings.
    
    Most situations are simple, but remember that siblings and parents in hydrus can get complex. If you want to display this data, I recommend you plan to support simple service-specific workflows, and add hooks to recognise conflicts and other difficulty and, when that happens, abandon ship (send the user back to Hydrus proper). Also, if you show summaries of the data anywhere, make sure you add a 'and 22 more...' overflow mechanism to your menus, since if you hit up 'azur lane' or 'pokemon', you are going to get hundreds of children.
    
    I generally warn you off computing sibling and parent mappings or counts yourself. The data from this request is best used for sibling and parent decorators on individual tags in a 'manage tags' presentation. The code that actually computes what siblings and parents look like in the 'display' context can be a pain at times, and I've already done it. Just run /search_tags or /file_metadata again after any changes you make and you'll get updated values.

### **GET `/add_tags/search_tags`** { id="add_tags_search_tags" }

_Search the client for tags._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Search for Files and Add Tags permission needed.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments:
:   
    * `search`: (the tag text to search for, enter exactly what you would in the client UI)
    * [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, defaults to _all my files_)
    * `tag_service_key`: (optional, hexadecimal, the tag domain on which to search, defaults to _all known tags_)
    * `tag_display_type`: (optional, string, to select whether to search raw or sibling-processed tags, defaults to `storage`)

The `file domain` and `tag_service_key` perform the function of the file and tag domain buttons in the client UI.

The `tag_display_type` can be either `storage` (the default), which searches your file's stored tags, just as they appear in a 'manage tags' dialog, or `display`, which searches the sibling-processed tags, just as they appear in a normal file search page. In the example above, setting the `tag_display_type` to `display` could well combine the two kim possible tags and give a count of 3 or 4. 

'all my files'/'all known tags' works fine for most cases, but a specific tag service or 'all known files'/'tag service' can work better for editing tag repository `storage` contexts, since it provides results just for that service, and for repositories, it gives tags for all the non-local files other users have tagged.

Example request:
:   
```http title="Example request"
/add_tags/search_tags?search=kim&tag_display_type=display
```

Response:
:   Some JSON listing the client's matching tags.

:   
```json title="Example response"
{
  "tags" : [
    {
      "value" : "series:kim possible", 
      "count" : 3
    },
    {
      "value" : "kimchee", 
      "count" : 2
    },
    {
      "value" : "character:kimberly ann possible", 
      "count" : 1
    }
  ]
}
```

The `tags` list will be sorted by descending count. The various rules in _tags->manage tag display and search_ (e.g. no pure `*` searches on certain services) will also be checked--and if violated, you will get 200 OK but an empty result.

Note that if your client api access is only allowed to search certain tags, the results will be similarly filtered.

### **POST `/add_tags/add_tags`** { id="add_tags_add_tags" }

_Make changes to the tags that files have._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Add Tags permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments (in JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)
*   `service_keys_to_tags`: (selective B, an Object of service keys to lists of tags to be 'added' to the files)
*   `service_keys_to_actions_to_tags`: (selective B, an Object of service keys to content update actions to lists of tags)
*   `override_previously_deleted_mappings`: (optional, default `true`)
*   `create_new_deleted_mappings`: (optional, default `true`)

    In 'service\_keys\_to...', the keys are as in [/get\_services](#get_services). You may need some selection UI on your end so the user can pick what to do if there are multiple choices.
    
    Also, you can use either '...to\_tags', which is simple and add-only, or '...to\_actions\_to\_tags', which is more complicated and allows you to remove/petition or rescind pending content.
    
    The permitted 'actions' are:

    *   0 - Add to a local tag service.
    *   1 - Delete from a local tag service.
    *   2 - Pend to a tag repository.
    *   3 - Rescind a pend from a tag repository.
    *   4 - Petition from a tag repository. (This is special)
    *   5 - Rescind a petition from a tag repository.
    
    Read about [Current Deleted Pending Petitioned](#CDPP) for more info on these states.
    
    When you petition a tag from a repository, a 'reason' for the petition is typically needed. If you send a normal list of tags here, a default reason of "Petitioned from API" will be given. If you want to set your own reason, you can instead give a list of \[ tag, reason \] pairs.

Some example requests:
:   
```json title="Adding some tags to a file"
{
  "hash" : "df2a7b286d21329fc496e3aa8b8a08b67bb1747ca32749acb3f5d544cbfc0f56",
  "service_keys_to_tags" : {
    "6c6f63616c2074616773" : ["character:supergirl", "rating:safe"]
  }
}
```
```json title="Adding more tags to two files"
{
  "hashes" : [
    "df2a7b286d21329fc496e3aa8b8a08b67bb1747ca32749acb3f5d544cbfc0f56",
    "f2b022214e711e9a11e2fcec71bfd524f10f0be40c250737a7861a5ddd3faebf"
  ],
  "service_keys_to_tags" : {
    "6c6f63616c2074616773" : ["process this"],
    "ccb0cf2f9e92c2eb5bd40986f72a339ef9497014a5fb8ce4cea6d6c9837877d9" : ["creator:dandon fuga"]
  }
}
```
```json title="A complicated transaction with all possible actions"
{
  "hash" : "df2a7b286d21329fc496e3aa8b8a08b67bb1747ca32749acb3f5d544cbfc0f56",
  "service_keys_to_actions_to_tags" : {
    "6c6f63616c2074616773" : {
      "0" : ["character:supergirl", "rating:safe"],
      "1" : ["character:superman"]
    },
    "aa0424b501237041dab0308c02c35454d377eebd74cfbc5b9d7b3e16cc2193e9" : {
      "2" : ["character:supergirl", "rating:safe"],
      "3" : ["filename:image.jpg"],
      "4" : [["creator:danban faga", "typo"], ["character:super_girl", "underscore"]],
      "5" : ["skirt"]
    }
  }
}
```

This last example is far more complicated than you will usually see. Pend rescinds and petition rescinds are not common. Petitions are also quite rare, and gathering a good petition reason for each tag is often a pain.

Note that the enumerated status keys in the service\_keys\_to\_actions\_to_tags structure are strings, not ints (JSON does not support int keys for Objects).

The `override_previously_deleted_mappings` parameter adjusts your Add/Pend actions. In the client, if a human, in the _manage tags dialog_, tries to add a tag mapping that has been previously deleted, that deleted record will be overwritten. An automatic system like a gallery parser will filter/skip any Add/Pend actions in this case (so that repeat downloads do not overwrite a human user delete, etc..). The Client API acts like a human, by default, overwriting previously deleted mappings. If you want to spam a lot of new mappings but do not want to overwrite previously deletion decisions, acting like a downloader, then set this to `false`.

The `create_new_deleted_mappings` parameter adjusts your Delete/Petition actions, particularly whether a delete record should be made _even if the tag does not exist on the file_. There are not many ways to spontaneously create a delete record in the normal hydrus UI, but you as the Client API should think whether this is what you want. By default, the Client API will write a delete record whether the tag already exists for the file or not. If you only want to create a delete record (which prohibits the tag being added back again by something like a downloader, as with `override_previously_deleted_mappings`) when the tag already exists on the file, then set this to `false`. Are you saying 'migrate all these deleted tag records from A to B so that none of them are re-added'? Then you want this `true`. Are you saying 'This tag was applied incorrectly to some but perhaps not all of of these files; where it exists, delete it.'? Then set it `false`.

There is currently no way to delete a tag mapping without leaving a delete record (as you can with files). This will probably happen, though, and it'll be a new parameter here.

Response description:
:  200 and no content.

!!! note
    Note also that hydrus tag actions are safely idempotent. You can pend a tag that is already pended, or add a tag that already exists, and not worry about an error--the surplus add action will be discarded. The same is true if you try to pend a tag that actually already exists, or rescinding a petition that doesn't. Any invalid actions will fail silently.
    
    It is fine to just throw your 'process this' tags at every file import and not have to worry about checking which files you already added them to.

## Editing File Ratings

### **POST `/edit_ratings/set_rating`** { id="edit_ratings_set_rating" }

_Add or remove ratings associated with a file._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Edit Ratings permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:       
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)
*   `rating_service_key` : (hexadecimal, the rating service you want to edit)
*   `rating` : (mixed datatype, the rating value you want to set)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "hash" : "3b820114f658d768550e4e3d4f1dced3ff8db77443472b5ad93700647ad2d3ba",
  "rating_service_key" : "282303611ba853659aa60aeaa5b6312d40e05b58822c52c57ae5e320882ba26e",
  "rating" : 2
}
```

This is fairly simple, but there are some caveats around the different rating service types and the actual data you are setting here. It is the same as you'll see in [GET /get\_files/file\_metadata](#get_files_file_metadata). 

#### Like/Dislike Ratings

Send `true` for 'like', `false` for 'dislike', or `null` for 'unset'.

#### Numerical Ratings

Send an `int` for the number of stars to set, or `null` for 'unset'.

#### Inc/Dec Ratings

Send an `int` for the number to set. 0 is your minimum.

As with [GET /get\_files/file\_metadata](#get_files_file_metadata), check [The Services Object](#services_object) for the min/max stars on a numerical rating service. 

Response: 
:   200 and no content.

## Editing File Times

### **POST `/edit_times/increment_file_viewtime`** { id="edit_times_increment_file_viewtime" }

_Add a file view to the file viewing statistics system._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Edit Times permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:       
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)
*   `canvas_type` : (int, the canvas type you are editing)
*   `timestamp` : (optional, selective, float or int of the "last viewed time" in seconds)
*   `timestamp_ms` : (optional, selective, int of the "last viewed time" in milliseconds)
*   `views` : (optional, int, how many views you are adding, defaults to 1)
*   `viewtime` : (float, how long the user viewed the file for)

```json title="Example request body; adding a single view"
{
  "file_id" : 123456,
  "canvas_type" : 0,
  "viewtime" : 8.423
}
```

```json title="Example request body; setting the time when the user started viewing the file"
{
  "file_id" : 123456,
  "canvas_type" : 4,
  "timestamp" : 1738010610.073,
  "viewtime" : 8.423
}
```

```json title="Example request body; sending a batch of views"
{
  "file_id" : 123456,
  "canvas_type" : 4,
  "timestamp" : 1738010610.073, 
  "views" : 3,
  "viewtime" : 31.245
}
```

This increments the number of views stored for the file in the file viewing statistics system. This system records "last time the file was viewed", "total number of views", and "total viewtime" for three different `canvas_types`:

*   0 - Media Viewer (the normal viewer in hydrus that is its own window)
*   1 - Preview Viewer (the box in the bottom-left corner of the Main GUI window)
*   4 - Client API Viewer (something to represent your own access, if you wish)

It doesn't matter much, but in hydrus the "last time the file was viewed" is considered to be when the user _started_ viewing the file, not ended, so if you wish to track that too, you can send it along. If you do not include a `timestamp`, the system will use _now_, which is close enough, assuming you are sending recent rather than deferred data.

You can send multiple file identifiers, but I imagine you will just be sending one most of the time.

If the user has disabled file viewing statistics tracking on their client (under the options), this will 403.

Response: 
:   200 and no content.

### **POST `/edit_times/set_file_viewtime`** { id="edit_times_set_file_viewtime" }

_Set fixed values in the file viewing statistics system._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Edit Times permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:       
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)
*   `canvas_type` : (int, the canvas type you are editing)
*   `timestamp` : (optional, selective, float or int of the "last viewed time" in seconds)
*   `timestamp_ms` : (optional, selective, int of the "last viewed time" in milliseconds)
*   `views` : (int, how many views you are adding)
*   `viewtime` : (float, how long the user viewed the file for)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "file_id" : 123456,
  "canvas_type" : 0,
  "timestamp" : 1738010610.073,
  "views" : 5,
  "viewtime" : 184.423
}
```

This is an override to set the number of views stored for the file in the file viewing statistics system to fixed values you specify. I recommend you only use this call for unusual maintenance, migration, or reset situations--stick to the [/edit\_times/increment\_file\_viewtime](#edit_times_increment_file_viewtime) call for normal use.

The system records "last time the file was viewed", "total number of views", and "total viewtime" for three different `canvas_types`:

*   0 - Media Viewer (the normal viewer in hydrus that is its own window)
*   1 - Preview Viewer (the box in the bottom-left corner of the Main GUI window)
*   4 - Client API Viewer (something to represent your own access, if you wish)

The "Client API" viewer was added so you may record your views separately if you wish. Otherwise you might like to fold them into the normal Media viewer count.

If you do not include a `timestamp`, the system will either leave what is currently recorded, or, if the file has no viewing data yet, fill in with _now_.

You can send multiple file identifiers, but I imagine you will just be sending one.

If the user has disabled file viewing statistics tracking on their client (under the options), this will 403.

Response: 
:   200 and no content.

### **POST `/edit_times/set_time`** { id="edit_times_set_time" }

_Add or remove timestamps associated with a file._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Edit Times permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:       
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
*   [files](#parameters_files)
*   `timestamp` : (selective, float or int of the time in seconds, or `null` for deleting web domain times)
*   `timestamp_ms` : (selective, int of the time in milliseconds, or `null` for deleting web domain times)
*   `timestamp_type` : (int, the type of timestamp you are editing)
*   `file_service_key` : (dependant, hexadecimal, the file service you are editing in 'imported'/'deleted'/'previously imported')
*   `canvas_type` : (dependant, int, the canvas type you are editing in 'last viewed')
*   `domain` : (dependant, string, the domain you are editing in 'modified (web domain)')

```json title="Example request body, simple"
{
  "file_id" : 123456,
  "timestamp" : "1641044491",
  "timestamp_type" : 5
}
```

```json title="Example request body, more complicated"
{
  "file_id" : 123456,
  "timestamp" : "1641044491.458",
  "timestamp_type" : 6,
  "canvas_type" : 1
}
```

```json title="Example request body, deleting"
{
  "file_id" : 123456,
  "timestamp_ms" : null,
  "timestamp_type" : 0,
  "domain" : "blahbooru.org"
}
```

This is a copy of the _manage times_ dialog in the program, so if you are uncertain about something, check that out. The client records timestamps up to millisecond accuracy.

You have to select some files, obviously. I'd imagine most uses will be over one file at a time, but you can spam 100 or 10,000 if you need to.

Then choose whether you want to work with `timestamp` or `timestamp_ms`. `timestamp` can be an integer or a float, and in the latter case, the API will suck up the three most significant digits to be the millisecond data. `timestamp_ms` is an integer of milliseconds, simply the `timestamp` value multiplied by 1,000. It doesn't matter which you use--whichever is easiest for you.

If you send `null` timestamp time, then this will instruct to delete the existing value, if possible and reasonable.

`timestamp_type` is an enum as follows:

*   0 - File modified time (web domain)
*   1 - File modified time (on the hard drive)
*   3 - File import time

!!! warning "Adding or Deleting"
    You can add or delete type 0 (web domain) timestamps, but you can only edit existing instances of all the others. This is broadly how the _manage times_ dialog works, also. Stuff like 'last viewed' is tied up with other numbers like viewtime and num_views, so if that isn't already in the database, then we can't just add the timestamp on its own. Same with 'deleted time' for a file that isn't deleted! So, in general, other than web domain stuff, you can only edit times you already see in [/get\_files/file\_metadata](#get_files_file_metadata).

If you select 0, you have to include a `domain`, which will usually be a web domain, but you can put anything in there.

If you select 1, the client will _not_ alter the modified time on your hard disk, only the database record. This is unlike the dialog. Let's let this system breathe a bit before we try to get too clever.

If you select 3, 4, or 7, you have to include a `file_service_key`. The 'previously imported' time is for deleted files only; it records when the file was originally imported so if the user hits 'undo', the database knows what import time to give back to it.

If you select 6, you have to include a `canvas_type`, which is:

*   0 - Media Viewer (the normal viewer in hydrus that is its own window)
*   1 - Preview Viewer (the box in the bottom-left corner of the Main GUI window)
*   4 - Client API Viewer (something to represent your own access, if you wish)

## Editing File Notes

### **POST `/add_notes/set_notes`** { id="add_notes_set_notes" }

_Add or update notes associated with a file._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Add Notes permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:       
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
* `notes`: (an Object mapping string names to string texts)
* `hash`: (selective, an SHA256 hash for the file in 64 characters of hexadecimal)
* `file_id`: (selective, the integer numerical identifier for the file)
* `merge_cleverly`: true or false (optional, defaults false)
* `extend_existing_note_if_possible`: true or false (optional, defaults true)
* `conflict_resolution`: 0, 1, 2, or 3 (optional, defaults 3)

With `merge_cleverly` left `false`, then this is a simple update operation. Existing notes will be overwritten exactly as you specify. Any other notes the file has will be untouched.
```json title="Example request body"
{
  "notes" : {
      "note name" : "content of note",
      "another note" : "asdf"
  },
  "hash" : "3b820114f658d768550e4e3d4f1dced3ff8db77443472b5ad93700647ad2d3ba"
}
```

If you turn on `merge_cleverly`, then the client will merge your new notes into the file's existing notes using the same logic you have seen in Note Import Options and the Duplicate Metadata Merge Options. This navigates conflict resolution, and you should use it if you are adding potential duplicate content from an 'automatic' source like a parser and do not want to wade into the logic. Do not use it for a user-editing experience (a user expects a strict overwrite/replace experience and will be confused by this mode).

To start off, in this mode, if your note text exists under a different name for the file, your dupe note will not be added to your new name. `extend_existing_note_if_possible` makes it so your existing note text will overwrite an existing name (or a '... (1)' rename of that name) if the existing text is inside your given text. `conflict_resolution` is an enum governing what to do in all other conflicts:

_If a new note name already exists and its new text differs from what already exists:_
:  
* 0 - replace - Overwrite the existing conflicting note.
* 1 - ignore - Make no changes.
* 2 - append - Append the new text to the existing text.
* 3 - rename (default) - Add the new text under a 'name (x)'-style rename.

Response: 
:   200 with the note changes actually sent through. If `merge_cleverly=false`, this is exactly what you gave, and this operation is idempotent. If `merge_cleverly=true`, then this may differ, even be empty, and this operation might not be idempotent.
```json title="Example response"
{
  "notes" : {
    "note name" : "content of note",
    "another note (1)" : "asdf"
  }
}
```


### **POST `/add_notes/delete_notes`** { id="add_notes_delete_notes" }

_Remove notes associated with a file._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Add Notes permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:       
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
*   `note_names`: (a list of string note names to delete)
*   `hash`: (selective, an SHA256 hash for the file in 64 characters of hexadecimal)
*   `file_id`: (selective, the integer numerical identifier for the file)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "note_names" : ["note name", "another note"],
  "hash" : "3b820114f658d768550e4e3d4f1dced3ff8db77443472b5ad93700647ad2d3ba"
}
```

Response:  
:   200 with no content. This operation is idempotent.

## Searching and Fetching Files

File search in hydrus is not paginated like a booru--all searches return all results in one go. In order to keep this fast, search is split into two steps--fetching file identifiers with a search, and then fetching file metadata in batches. You may have noticed that the client itself performs searches like this--thinking a bit about a search and then bundling results in batches of 256 files before eventually throwing all the thumbnails on screen.

### **GET `/get_files/search_files`** { id="get_files_search_files" }

_Search for the client's files._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Search for Files permission needed. Additional search permission limits may apply.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
    *   `tags`: (a list of tags you wish to search for)
    *   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, defaults to _all my files_)
    *   `tag_service_key`: (optional, hexadecimal, the tag domain on which to search, defaults to _all my files_)
    *   `include_current_tags`: (optional, bool, whether to search 'current' tags, defaults to `true`)
    *   `include_pending_tags`: (optional, bool, whether to search 'pending' tags, defaults to `true`)
    *   `file_sort_type`: (optional, integer, the results sort method, defaults to `2` for `import time`)
    *   `file_sort_asc`: true or false (optional, default `true`, the results sort order)
    *   `return_file_ids`: true or false (optional, default `true`, returns file id results)
    *   `return_hashes`: true or false (optional, default `false`, returns hex hash results)

``` title='Example request for 16 files (system:limit=16) in the inbox with tags "blue eyes", "blonde hair", and "кино"'
/get_files/search_files?tags=%5B%22blue%20eyes%22%2C%20%22blonde%20hair%22%2C%20%22%5Cu043a%5Cu0438%5Cu043d%5Cu043e%22%2C%20%22system%3Ainbox%22%2C%20%22system%3Alimit%3D16%22%5D
```
    

If the access key's permissions only permit search for certain tags, at least one positive whitelisted/non-blacklisted tag must be in the "tags" list or this will 403. Tags can be prepended with a hyphen to make a negated tag (e.g. "-green eyes"), but these will not be checked against the permissions whitelist.

Wildcards and namespace searches are supported, so if you search for 'character:sam*' or 'series:*', this will be handled correctly clientside.

**Many system predicates are also supported using a text parser!** The parser was designed by a clever user for human input and allows for a certain amount of error (e.g. ~= instead of ≈, or "isn't" instead of "is not") or requires more information (e.g. the specific hashes for a hash lookup). **Here's a big list of examples that are supported:**

Please test out the system predicates you want to send. If you are in _help-&gt;advanced mode_, you can test this parser in the advanced text input dialog when you click the OR\* button on a tag autocomplete dropdown. More system predicate types and input formats will be available in future. Reverse engineering system predicate data from text is obviously tricky. If a system predicate does not parse, you'll get 400.

Also, OR predicates are now supported! Just nest within the tag list, and it'll be treated like an OR. For instance:

*   `#!json [ "skirt", [ "samus aran", "lara croft" ], "system:height > 1000" ]`

Makes:

*   skirt
*   samus aran OR lara croft
*   system:height > 1000

The file and tag services are for search domain selection, just like clicking the buttons in the client. They are optional--default is 'all my files' and 'all known tags'.

`include_current_tags` and `include_pending_tags` do the same as the buttons on the normal search interface. They alter the search of normal tags and tag-related system predicates like 'system:number of tags', including or discluding that type of tag from whatever the search is doing. If you set both of these to `false`, you'll often get no results.

File searches occur in the `display` `tag_display_type`. If you want to pair autocomplete tag lookup from [/search_tags](#add_tags_search_tags) to this file search (e.g. for making a standard booru search interface), then make sure you are searching `display` tags there.

file\_sort\_asc is 'true' for ascending, and 'false' for descending. The default is descending.

file\_sort\_type is by default _import time_. It is an integer according to the following enum, and I have written the semantic (asc/desc) meaning for each type after:

* 0 - file size (smallest first/largest first)
* 1 - duration (shortest first/longest first)
* 2 - import time (oldest first/newest first)
* 3 - filetype (N/A)
* 4 - random (N/A)
* 5 - width (slimmest first/widest first)
* 6 - height (shortest first/tallest first)
* 7 - ratio (tallest first/widest first)
* 8 - number of pixels (ascending/descending)
* 9 - number of tags (on the current tag domain) (ascending/descending)
* 10 - number of media views (ascending/descending)
* 11 - total media viewtime (ascending/descending)
* 12 - approximate bitrate (smallest first/largest first)
* 13 - has audio (audio first/silent first)
* 14 - modified time (oldest first/newest first)
* 15 - framerate (slowest first/fastest first)
* 16 - number of frames (smallest first/largest first)
* 18 - last viewed time (oldest first/newest first)
* 19 - archive timestamp (oldest first/newest first)
* 20 - hash hex (lexicographic/reverse lexicographic)
* 21 - pixel hash hex (lexicographic/reverse lexicographic)
* 22 - blurhash (lexicographic/reverse lexicographic)
* 23 - average colour - lightness (darkest first/lightest first)
* 24 - average colour - chromatic magnitude (greys first/colours first)
* 25 - average colour - green/red axis (greens first/reds first)
* 26 - average colour - blue/yellow axis (blues first/yellows first)
* 27 - average colour - hue (rainbow - red first/rainbow - purple first)

The pixel, blurhash, and average colour sorts will put files without one of these (e.g. an mp3) at the end, regardless of asc/desc.

Response:
:   The full list of numerical file ids that match the search.
```json title="Example response"
{
	"file_ids" : [125462, 4852415, 123, 591415]
}
```
```json title="Example response with return_hashes=true"
{
  "hashes" : [
    "1b04c4df7accd5a61c5d02b36658295686b0abfebdc863110e7d7249bba3f9ad",
    "fe416723c731d679aa4d20e9fd36727f4a38cd0ac6d035431f0f452fad54563f",
    "b53505929c502848375fbc4dab2f40ad4ae649d34ef72802319a348f81b52bad"
  ],
  "file_ids" : [125462, 4852415, 123]
}
```

    You can of course also specify `return_hashes=true&return_file_ids=false` just to get the hashes. The order of both lists is the same.

    File ids are internal and specific to an individual client. For a client, a file with hash H always has the same file id N, but two clients will have different ideas about which N goes with which H. IDs are a bit faster to retrieve than hashes and search with _en masse_, which is why they are exposed here.

    This search does **not** apply the implicit limit that most clients set to all searches (usually 10,000), so if you do system:everything on a client with millions of files, expect to get boshed. Even with a system:limit included, complicated queries with large result sets may take several seconds to respond. Just like the client itself.

### **GET `/get_files/file_hashes`** { id="get_files_file_hashes" }

_Lookup file hashes from other hashes._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Search for Files permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
    *   `hash`: (selective, a hexadecimal hash)
    *   `hashes`: (selective, a list of hexadecimal hashes)
    *   `source_hash_type`: [sha256|md5|sha1|sha512] (optional, defaulting to sha256)
    *   `desired_hash_type`: [sha256|md5|sha1|sha512]

If you have some MD5 hashes and want to see what their SHA256 are, or _vice versa_, this is the place. Hydrus records the non-SHA256 hashes for every file it has ever imported. This data is not removed on file deletion.

``` title="Example request"
/get_files/file_hashes?hash=ec5c5a4d7da4be154597e283f0b6663c&source_hash_type=md5&desired_hash_type=sha256
```

Response:
:   A mapping Object of the successful lookups. Where no matching hash is found, no entry will be made (therefore, if none of your source hashes have matches on the client, this will return an empty `hashes` Object).
```json title="Example response"
{
  "hashes" : {
    "ec5c5a4d7da4be154597e283f0b6663c" : "2a0174970defa6f147f2eabba829c5b05aba1f1aea8b978611a07b7bb9cf9399"
  }
}
```

### **GET `/get_files/file_metadata`** { id="get_files_file_metadata" }

_Get metadata about files in the client._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Search for Files permission needed. Additional search permission limits may apply.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
    *   [files](#parameters_files)
    *   `create_new_file_ids`: true or false (optional if asking with hash(es), defaulting to false)
    *   `only_return_identifiers`: true or false (optional, defaulting to false)
    *   `only_return_basic_information`: true or false (optional, defaulting to false)
    *   `detailed_url_information`: true or false (optional, defaulting to false)
    *   `include_blurhash`: true or false (optional, defaulting to false. Only applies when `only_return_basic_information` is true)
    *   `include_milliseconds`: true or false (optional, defaulting to false)
    *   `include_notes`: true or false (optional, defaulting to false)
    *   `include_services_object`: true or false (optional, defaulting to true)
    *   `hide_service_keys_tags`: **Deprecated, will be deleted soon!** true or false (optional, defaulting to true)

If your access key is restricted by tag, **the files you search for must have been in the most recent search result**.

``` title="Example request for two files with ids 123 and 4567"
/get_files/file_metadata?file_ids=%5B123%2C%204567%5D
```
    
``` title="The same, but only wants hashes back"
/get_files/file_metadata?file_ids=%5B123%2C%204567%5D&only_return_identifiers=true
```
    
``` title="And one that fetches two hashes"
/get_files/file_metadata?hashes=%5B%224c77267f93415de0bc33b7725b8c331a809a924084bee03ab2f5fae1c6019eb2%22%2C%20%223e7cb9044fe81bda0d7a84b5cb781cba4e255e4871cba6ae8ecd8207850d5b82%22%5D
```

This request string can obviously get pretty ridiculously long. It also takes a bit of time to fetch metadata from the database. In its normal searches, the client usually fetches file metadata in batches of 256.

Response:
:   A list of JSON Objects that store a variety of file metadata. Also [The Services Object](#services_object) for service reference.

#### basics

Size is in bytes. Duration is in milliseconds, and may be an int or a float.

`is_trashed` means if the file is currently in the trash but available on the hard disk. `is_deleted` means currently either in the trash or completely deleted from disk.

`file_services` stores which file services the file is <i>current</i>ly in and _deleted_ from. The entries are by the service key, same as for tags later on. In rare cases, the timestamps may be `null`, if they are unknown (e.g. a `time_deleted` for the file deleted before this information was tracked). The `time_modified` can also be null. Time modified is just the filesystem modified time for now, but it will evolve into more complicated storage in future with multiple locations (website post times) that'll be aggregated to a sensible value in UI.

`ipfs_multihashes` stores the ipfs service key to any known multihash for the file. 

The `thumbnail_width` and `thumbnail_height` are a generally reliable prediction but aren't a promise. The actual thumbnail you get from [/get\_files/thumbnail](#get_files_thumbnail) will be different if the user hasn't looked at it since changing their thumbnail options. You only get these rows for files that hydrus actually generates an actual thumbnail for. Things like pdf won't have it. You can use your own thumb, or ask the api and it'll give you a fixed fallback; those are mostly 200x200, but you can and should size them to whatever you want.

`include_notes` will decide whether to show a file's notes, in a simple names->texts Object.

`include_milliseconds` will determine if timestamps are integers (`1641044491`), which is the default, or floats with three significant figures (`1641044491.485`). As of v559, all file timestamps across the program are internally tracked with milliseconds.

If the file has a thumbnail, `blurhash` gives a base 83 encoded string of its [blurhash](https://blurha.sh/). `pixel_hash` is an SHA256 of the image's pixel data and should exactly match for pixel-identical files (it is used in the duplicate system for 'must be pixel duplicates').

If the file's filetype is forced by the user, `filetype_forced` becomes `true` and a second mime string, `original_mime` is added.

#### tags

The `tags` structure is similar to the [/add\_tags/add\_tags](#add_tags_add_tags) scheme, excepting that the status numbers are:

*   0 - current
*   1 - pending
*   2 - deleted
*   3 - petitioned

!!! note
    Since JSON Object keys must be strings, these status numbers are strings, not ints.

Read about [Current Deleted Pending Petitioned](#CDPP) for more info on these states.

While the 'storage_tags' represent the actual tags stored on the database for a file, 'display_tags' reflect how tags appear in the UI, after siblings are collapsed and parents are added. If you want to edit a file's tags, refer to the storage tags. If you want to render to the user, use the display tags. The display tag calculation logic is very complicated; if the storage tags change, do not try to guess the new display tags yourself--just ask the API again. 

#### ratings

The `ratings` structure is simple, but it holds different data types. For each service:

- For a like/dislike service, 'no rating' is null. 'like' is true, 'dislike' is false.
- For a numerical service, 'no rating' is null. Otherwise it will be an integer, for the number of stars.
- For an inc/dec service, it is always an integer. The default value is 0 for all files.

Check [The Services Object](#services_object) to see the shape of a rating star, and min/max number of stars in a numerical service. 

#### services

The `tags`, `ratings`, and `file_services` structures use the hexadecimal `service_key` extensively. If you need to look up the respective service name or type, check [The Services Object](#services_object) under the top level `services` key.

!!! note
    If you look, those file structures actually include the service name and type already, but this bloated data is deprecated and will be deleted in 2024, so please transition over.

If you don't want the services object (it is generally superfluous on the 'simple' responses), then add `include_services_object=false`.

#### parameters

The `metadata` list _should_ come back in the same sort order you asked, whether that is in `file_ids` or `hashes`!

If you ask with hashes rather than file_ids, hydrus will, by default, only return results when it has seen those hashes before. This is to stop the client making thousands of new file_id records in its database if you perform a scanning operation. If you ask about a hash the client has never encountered before--for which there is no file_id--you will get this style of result:

```json title="Missing file_id example"
{
    "metadata" : [
        {
            "file_id" : null,
            "hash" : "766da61f81323629f982bc1b71b5c1f9bba3f3ed61caf99906f7f26881c3ae93"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can change this behaviour with `create_new_file_ids=true`, but bear in mind you will get a fairly 'empty' metadata result with lots of 'null' lines, so this is only useful for gathering the numerical ids for later Client API work.

If you ask about file_ids that do not exist, you'll get 404.

If you set `only_return_basic_information=true`, this will be much faster for first-time requests than the full metadata result, but it will be slower for repeat requests. The full metadata object is cached after first fetch, the limited file info object is not. You can optionally set `include_blurhash` when using this option to fetch blurhash strings for the files.

If you add `detailed_url_information=true`, a new entry, `detailed_known_urls`, will be added for each file, with a list of the same structure as /`add_urls/get_url_info`. This may be an expensive request if you are querying thousands of files at once.

```json title="For example"
{
  "detailed_known_urls": [
    {
      "normalised_url": "https://somebooru.org/index.php?id=123456&page=post&s=view",

### **GET `/get_files/file`** { id="get_files_file" }

_Get a file._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Search for Files permission needed. Additional search permission limits may apply.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments :
:   
    *   `file_id`: (selective, numerical file id for the file)
    *   `hash`: (selective, a hexadecimal SHA256 hash for the file)
    *   `download`: (optional, boolean, default `false`)

Only use one of `file_id` or `hash`. As with metadata fetching, you may only use the hash argument if you have access to all files. If you are tag-restricted, you will have to use a file_id in the last search you ran.

``` title="Example request"
/get_files/file?file_id=452158
```
``` title="Example request"
/get_files/file?hash=7f30c113810985b69014957c93bc25e8eb4cf3355dae36d8b9d011d8b0cf623a&download=true
```
   
Response:
:   The file itself. You should get the correct mime type as the Content-Type header.

By default, this will set the `Content-Disposition` header to `inline`, which causes a web browser to show the file. If you set `download=true`, it will set it to `attachment`, which triggers the browser to automatically download it (or open the 'save as' dialog) instead.

This stuff supports `Range` requests, so if you want to build a video player, go nuts.

### **GET `/get_files/thumbnail`** { id="get_files_thumbnail" }

_Get a file's thumbnail._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Search for Files permission needed. Additional search permission limits may apply.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments:
:   
    *   `file_id`: (selective, numerical file id for the file)
    *   `hash`: (selective, a hexadecimal SHA256 hash for the file)

Only use one. As with metadata fetching, you may only use the hash argument if you have access to all files. If you are tag-restricted, you will have to use a file_id in the last search you ran.

``` title="Example request"
/get_files/thumbnail?file_id=452158
```
``` title="Example request"
/get_files/thumbnail?hash=7f30c113810985b69014957c93bc25e8eb4cf3355dae36d8b9d011d8b0cf623a
```

Response:
:   The thumbnail for the file. Some hydrus thumbs are jpegs, some are pngs. It should give you the correct image/jpeg or image/png Content-Type.

    If hydrus keeps no thumbnail for the filetype, for instance with pdfs, then you will get the same default 'pdf' icon you see in the client. If the file does not exist in the client, or the thumbnail was expected but is missing from storage, you will get the fallback 'hydrus' icon, again just as you would in the client itself. This request should never give a 404.

!!! note "Size of Normal Thumbs"
    Thumbnails are not guaranteed to be the correct size! If a thumbnail has not been loaded in the client in years, it could well have been fitted for older thumbnail settings. Also, even 'clean' thumbnails will not always fit inside the settings' bounding box; they may be boosted due to a high-DPI setting or spill over due to a 'fill' vs 'fit' preference. You cannot easily predict what resolution a thumbnail will or should have!
    
    In general, thumbnails *are* the correct ratio. If you are drawing thumbs, you should embed them to fit or fill, but don't fix them at 100% true size: make sure they can scale to the size you want!

!!! note "Size of Defaults"
    If you get a 'default' filetype thumbnail like the pdf or hydrus one, you will be pulling the pngs straight from the hydrus/static folder. They will most likely be 200x200 pixels. 

### **GET `/get_files/file_path`** { id="get_files_file_path" }

_Get a local file path._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Search for Files permission and See Local Paths permission needed. Additional search permission limits may apply.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments :
:   
    *   `file_id`: (selective, numerical file id for the file)
    *   `hash`: (selective, a hexadecimal SHA256 hash for the file)

Only use one. As with metadata fetching, you may only use the hash argument if you have access to all files. If you are tag-restricted, you will have to use a file_id in the last search you ran.

``` title="Example request"
/get_files/file_path?file_id=452158
```
``` title="Example request"
/get_files/file_path?hash=7f30c113810985b69014957c93bc25e8eb4cf3355dae36d8b9d011d8b0cf623a
```

Response:
:   The actual path to the file on the host system. Filetype and size are included for convenience.

``` json title="Example response"
{
	"path" : "D:\hydrus_files\f7f\7f30c113810985b69014957c93bc25e8eb4cf3355dae36d8b9d011d8b0cf623a.jpg",
	"filetype" : "image/jpeg",
	"size" : 95237
}
```

This will give 404 if the file is not stored locally (which includes if it _should_ exist but is actually missing from the file store).

### **GET `/get_files/thumbnail_path`** { id="get_files_thumbnail_path" }

_Get a local thumbnail path._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Search for Files permission and See Local Paths permission needed. Additional search permission limits may apply.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments:
:   
    *   `file_id`: (selective, numerical file id for the file)
    *   `hash`: (selective, a hexadecimal SHA256 hash for the file)
    *   `include_thumbnail_filetype`: (optional, boolean, defaults to `false`)

Only use one of `file_id` or `hash`. As with metadata fetching, you may only use the hash argument if you have access to all files. If you are tag-restricted, you will have to use a file_id in the last search you ran.

``` title="Example request"
/get_files/thumbnail_path?file_id=452158
```
``` title="Example request"
/get_files/thumbnail_path?hash=7f30c113810985b69014957c93bc25e8eb4cf3355dae36d8b9d011d8b0cf623a&include_thumbnail_filetype=true
```

Response:
:   The actual path to the thumbnail on the host system.

``` json title="Example response"
{
	"path" : "D:\hydrus_files\f7f\7f30c113810985b69014957c93bc25e8eb4cf3355dae36d8b9d011d8b0cf623a.thumbnail"

All thumbnails in hydrus have the .thumbnail file extension and in content are either jpeg (almost always) or png (to handle transparency).

This will 400 if the given file type does not have a thumbnail in hydrus, and it will 404 if there should be a thumbnail but one does not exist and cannot be generated from the source file (which probably would mean that the source file was itself Not Found).

Note that `ideal_weight` and `max_num_bytes` are provided for courtesy and mean nothing fixed. Each storage location might store anything, thumbnails or files or nothing, regardless of the ideal situation. Whenever a folder is non-ideal, the 'move media files' dialog shows "files need to be moved now", but it will still keep doing its thing.

For now, a prefix only occurs in one location, so there will always be 512 total prefixes in this response, all unique. **However, please note that this will not always be true!** In a future expansion, the client will be, on user command, slowly migrating files from one place to another in the background, and during that time there will be multiple valid locations for a file to actually be. When this happens, you will have to hit all the possible locations and test.

Also, it won't be long before the client supports moving to _some_ form of three- and four-character prefix. I am still thinking how this will happen other than it will be an atomic change--no slow migration where we try to support both at once--but it will certainly complicate something in here (e.g. while the prefix may be 'f012', maybe the subfolder will be '\f01\2'), so we'll see.

### **GET `/get_files/render`** { id="get_files_render" }

_Get an image or ugoira file as rendered by Hydrus._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Search for Files permission needed. Additional search permission limits may apply.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments :
:   
    *   `file_id`: (selective, numerical file id for the file)
    *   `hash`: (selective, a hexadecimal SHA256 hash for the file)
    *   `download`: (optional, boolean, default `false`)
    *   `render_format`: (optional, integer, the filetype enum value to render the file to, for still images it defaults `2` for PNG, for Ugoiras it defaults to `23` for APNG)
    *   `render_quality`: (optional, integer, the quality or PNG compression level to use for encoding the image, default `1` for PNG and `80` for JPEG and WEBP, has no effect for Ugoiras using APNG)
    *   `width` and `height`: (optional but must provide both if used, integer, the width and height to scale the image to. Doesn't apply to Ugoiras)

    Only use one of file_id or hash. As with metadata fetching, you may only use the hash argument if you have access to all files. If you are tag-restricted, you will have to use a file_id in the last search you ran.
    
    Currently the accepted values for `render_format` for image files are:
    
    *   `1` for JPEG (`quality` sets JPEG quality 0 to 100, always progressive 4:2:0 encoding)
    *   `2` for PNG (`quality` sets the compression level from 0 to 9. A higher value means a smaller size and longer compression time)
    *   `33` for WEBP (`quality` sets WEBP quality 1 to 100, for values over 100 lossless compression is used)
    
    The accepted values for Ugoiras are:
    
    *   `23` for APNG (`quality` does nothing for this format)
    *   `83` for animated WEBP (`quality` sets WEBP quality 1 to 100, for values over 100 lossless compression is used)

The file you request must be a still image file that Hydrus can render (this includes PSD files) or a Ugoira file. This request uses the client image cache for images.

``` title="Example request"
/get_files/render?file_id=452158
```
``` title="Example request"
/get_files/render?hash=7f30c113810985b69014957c93bc25e8eb4cf3355dae36d8b9d011d8b0cf623a&download=true
```
   
Response:
:   A PNG (or APNG), JPEG, or WEBP file of the image as would be rendered in the client, optionally resized as specified in the query parameters. It will be converted to sRGB color if the file had a color profile but the rendered file will not have any color profile.

By default, this will set the `Content-Disposition` header to `inline`, which causes a web browser to show the file. If you set `download=true`, it will set it to `attachment`, which triggers the browser to automatically download it (or open the 'save as' dialog) instead.

## Managing File Relationships

This refers to the File Relationships system, which includes 'potential duplicates', 'duplicates', and 'alternates'.

This system is pending significant rework and expansion, so please do not get too married to some of the routines here. I am mostly just exposing my internal commands, so things are a little ugly/hacked. I expect duplicate and alternate groups to get some form of official identifier in future, which may end up being the way to refer and edit things here.

Also, at least for now, 'Manage File Relationships' permission is not going to be bound by the search permission restrictions that normal file search does. Getting this file relationship management permission allows you to search anything.

_There is more work to do here, including adding various 'dissolve'/'undo' commands to break groups apart._

### **GET `/manage_file_relationships/get_file_relationships`** { id="manage_file_relationships_get_file_relationships" }

_Get the current relationships for one or more files._

Restricted access:

Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):

`king` refers to which file is set as the best of a duplicate group. If you are doing potential duplicate comparisons, the kings of your two groups are usually the ideal representatives, and the 'get some pairs to filter'-style commands try to select the kings of the various to-be-compared duplicate groups. `is_king` is a convenience bool for when a file is king of its own group.

**It is possible for the king to not be available.** Every group has a king, but if that file has been deleted, or if the file domain here is limited and the king is on a different file service, then it may not be available. A similar issue occurs when you search for filtering pairs--while it is ideal to compare kings with kings, if you set 'files must be pixel dupes', then the user will expect to see those pixel duplicates, not their champions--you may be forced to compare non-kings. `king_is_on_file_domain` lets you know if the king is on the file domain you set, and `king_is_local` lets you know if it is on the hard disk--if `king_is_local=true`, you can do a `/get_files/file` request on it. It is generally rare, but you have to deal with the king being unavailable--in this situation, your best bet is to just use the file itself as its own representative.

All the relationships you get are filtered by the file domain. If you set the file domain to 'all known files', you will get every relationship a file has, including all deleted files, which is often less useful than you would think. The default, 'all my files', is usually most useful.

A file that has no duplicates is considered to be in a duplicate group of size 1 and thus is always its own king.

The numbers are from a duplicate status enum, as so:

* 0 - potential duplicates
* 1 - false positives
* 3 - alternates
* 8 - duplicates

Note that because of JSON constraints, these are the string versions of the integers since they are Object keys.

All the hashes given here are in 'all my files', i.e. not in the trash. A file may have duplicates that have long been deleted, but, like the null king above, they will not show here.

### **GET `/manage_file_relationships/get_potentials_count`** { id="manage_file_relationships_get_potentials_count" }

_Get the count of remaining potential duplicate pairs in a particular search domain. Exactly the same as the counts you see in the duplicate processing page._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage File Relationships permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
    *   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, defaults to _all my files_)
    *   `tag_service_key_1`: (optional, default 'all known tags', a hex tag service key)
    *   `tags_1`: (optional, default system:everything, a list of tags you wish to search for)
    *   `tag_service_key_2`: (optional, default 'all known tags', a hex tag service key)
    *   `tags_2`: (optional, default system:everything, a list of tags you wish to search for)
    *   `potentials_search_type`: (optional, integer, default 0, regarding how the pairs should match the search(es))
    *   `pixel_duplicates`: (optional, integer, default 1, regarding whether the pairs should be pixel duplicates)
    *   `max_hamming_distance`: (optional, integer, default 4, the max 'search distance' of the pairs)

``` title="Example request"
/manage_file_relationships/get_potentials_count?tag_service_key_1=c1ba23c60cda1051349647a151321d43ef5894aacdfb4b4e333d6c4259d56c5f&tags_1=%5B%22dupes_to_process%22%2C%20%22system%3Awidth%3C400%22%5D&potentials_search_type=1&pixel_duplicates=2&max_hamming_distance=0&max_num_pairs=50
```

`tag_service_key_x` and `tags_x` work the same as [/get\_files/search\_files](#get_files_search_files). The `_2` variants are only useful if the `potentials_search_type` is 2.

`potentials_search_type` and `pixel_duplicates` are enums:

* 0 - one file matches search 1
* 1 - both files match search 1
* 2 - one file matches search 1, the other 2

-and-

* 0 - must be pixel duplicates
* 1 - can be pixel duplicates
* 2 - must not be pixel duplicates

The `max_hamming_distance` is the same 'search distance' you see in the Client UI. A higher number means more speculative 'similar files' search. If `pixel_duplicates` is set to 'must be', then `max_hamming_distance` is obviously ignored.

Response:
:   A JSON Object stating the count.
``` json title="Example response"
{
	"potential_duplicates_count" : 17
}
```

If you confirm that a pair of potentials are duplicates, this may transitively collapse other potential pairs and decrease the count by more than 1.

### **GET `/manage_file_relationships/get_potential_pairs`** { id="manage_file_relationships_get_potential_pairs" }

_Get some potential duplicate pairs for a filtering workflow. Exactly the same as the 'duplicate filter' in the duplicate processing page._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage File Relationships permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
    *   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, defaults to _all my files_)
    *   `tag_service_key_1`: (optional, default 'all known tags', a hex tag service key)
    *   `tags_1`: (optional, default system:everything, a list of tags you wish to search for)
    *   `tag_service_key_2`: (optional, default 'all known tags', a hex tag service key)
    *   `tags_2`: (optional, default system:everything, a list of tags you wish to search for)
    *   `potentials_search_type`: (optional, integer, default 0, regarding how the pairs should match the search(es))
    *   `pixel_duplicates`: (optional, integer, default 1, regarding whether the pairs should be pixel duplicates)
    *   `max_hamming_distance`: (optional, integer, default 4, the max 'search distance' of the pairs)
    *   `max_num_pairs`: (optional, integer, defaults to client's option, how many pairs to get in a batch)

``` title="Example request"
/manage_file_relationships/get_potential_pairs?tag_service_key_1=c1ba23c60cda1051349647a151321d43ef5894aacdfb4b4e333d6c4259d56c5f&tags_1=%5B%22dupes_to_process%22%2C%20%22system%3Awidth%3C400%22%5D&potentials_search_type=1&pixel_duplicates=2&max_hamming_distance=0&max_num_pairs=50
```

The search arguments work the same as [/manage\_file\_relationships/get\_potentials\_count](#manage_file_relationships_get_potentials_count).

`max_num_pairs` is simple and just caps how many pairs you get.

Response:
:   A JSON Object listing a batch of hash pairs.
```json title="Example response"

	"potential_duplicate_pairs" : [
        [ "16470d6e73298cd75d9c7e8e2004810e047664679a660a9a3ba870b0fa3433d3", "7ed062dc76265d25abeee5425a859cfdf7ab26fd291f50b8de7ca381e04db079" ],

The selected pair sample and their order is strictly hardcoded for now (e.g. to guarantee that a decision will not invalidate any other pair in the batch, you shouldn't see the same file twice in a batch, nor two files in the same duplicate group). Treat it as the client filter does, where you fetch batches to process one after another. I expect to make it more flexible in future, in the client itself and here.

You will see significantly fewer than `max_num_pairs` (and potential duplicate count) as you close to the last available pairs, and when there are none left, you will get an empty list.

### **GET `/manage_file_relationships/get_random_potentials`** { id="manage_file_relationships_get_random_potentials" }

_Get some random potentially duplicate file hashes. Exactly the same as the 'show some random potential dupes' button in the duplicate processing page._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage File Relationships permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
    *   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, defaults to _all my files_)
    *   `tag_service_key_1`: (optional, default 'all known tags', a hex tag service key)
    *   `tags_1`: (optional, default system:everything, a list of tags you wish to search for)
    *   `tag_service_key_2`: (optional, default 'all known tags', a hex tag service key)
    *   `tags_2`: (optional, default system:everything, a list of tags you wish to search for)
    *   `potentials_search_type`: (optional, integer, default 0, regarding how the files should match the search(es))
    *   `pixel_duplicates`: (optional, integer, default 1, regarding whether the files should be pixel duplicates)
    *   `max_hamming_distance`: (optional, integer, default 4, the max 'search distance' of the files)

``` title="Example request"
/manage_file_relationships/get_random_potentials?tag_service_key_1=c1ba23c60cda1051349647a151321d43ef5894aacdfb4b4e333d6c4259d56c5f&tags_1=%5B%22dupes_to_process%22%2C%20%22system%3Awidth%3C400%22%5D&potentials_search_type=1&pixel_duplicates=2&max_hamming_distance=0
```

The arguments work the same as [/manage\_file\_relationships/get\_potentials\_count](#manage_file_relationships_get_potentials_count), with the caveat that `potentials_search_type` has special logic:

* 0 - first file matches search 1
* 1 - all files match search 1
* 2 - first file matches search 1, the others 2

Essentially, the first hash is the 'master' to which the others are paired. The other files will include every matching file.

Response:
:   A JSON Object listing a group of hashes exactly as the client would.
```json title="Example response"
{
	"random_potential_duplicate_hashes" : [
		"16470d6e73298cd75d9c7e8e2004810e047664679a660a9a3ba870b0fa3433d3",
        "7ed062dc76265d25abeee5425a859cfdf7ab26fd291f50b8de7ca381e04db079",
        "9e0d6b928b726562d70e1f14a7b506ba987c6f9b7f2d2e723809bb11494c73e6",
        "9e01744819b5ff2a84dda321e3f1a326f40d0e7f037408ded9f18a11ee2b2da8"
	]
}
```

If there are no potential duplicate groups in the search, this returns an empty list.

### **POST `/manage_file_relationships/remove_potentials`** { id="manage_file_relationships_remove_potentials" }

Remove all potential pairs that any of the given files are a part of. If you hit [/manage\_file\_relationships/get\_file\_relationships](#manage_file_relationships_get_file_relationships) after this on any of these files, they will have no potential relationships, and any hashes that were potential to them before will no longer, conversely, refer to these files as potentials.

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage File Relationships permission needed.

Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   [files](#parameters_files)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "file_id" : 123
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content.

If the files are a part of any potential pairs (with any files, including those you did not specify), those pairs will be deleted. This deletes everything they are involved in, and the files will not be queued up for a re-scan, so I recommend you only do this if you know you added the potentials yourself (e.g. this is regarding video files) or you otherwise have a plan to replace the deleted potential pairs with something more useful.

### **POST `/manage_file_relationships/set_file_relationships`** { id="manage_file_relationships_set_file_relationships" }

Set the relationships to the specified file pairs.

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage File Relationships permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `relationships`: (a list of Objects, one for each file-pair being set)

Each Object is:

    *   `hash_a`: (a hexadecimal SHA256 hash)
    *   `hash_b`: (a hexadecimal SHA256 hash)
    *   `relationship`: (integer enum for the relationship being set)
    *   `do_default_content_merge`: (bool)
    *   `delete_a`: (optional, bool, default false)
    *   `delete_b`: (optional, bool, default false)

`hash_a` and `hash_b` are normal hex SHA256 hashes for your file pair.

`relationship` is one of this enum:

* 0 - set as potential duplicates
* 1 - set as false positives
* 2 - set as same quality
* 3 - set as alternates
* 4 - set A as better
* 7 - set B as better

2, 4, and 7 all make the files 'duplicates' (8 under `/get_file_relationships`), which, specifically, merges the two files' duplicate groups. 'same quality' has different duplicate content merge options to the better/worse choices, but it ultimately sets something similar to A>B (but see below for more complicated outcomes). You obviously don't have to use 'B is better' if you prefer just to swap the hashes. Do what works for you.

`do_default_content_merge` sets whether the user's duplicate content merge options should be loaded and applied to the files along with the relationship. Most operations in the client do this automatically, so the user may expect it to apply, but if you want to do content merge yourself, set this to false.

`delete_a` and `delete_b` are booleans that select whether to delete A and/or B in the same operation as setting the relationship. You can also do this externally if you prefer.

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "relationships" : [
    {
      "hash_a" : "b54d09218e0d6efc964b78b070620a1fa19c7e069672b4c6313cee2c9b0623f2",

      "delete_b" : true
    },
    {

      "relationship" : 4,
      "do_default_content_merge" : true,
      "delete_b" : true
    },
    {
      "hash_a" : "0480513ffec391b77ad8c4e57fe80e5b710adfa3cb6af19b02a0bd7920f2d3ec",
      "hash_b" : "5fab162576617b5c3fc8caabea53ce3ab1a3c8e0a16c16ae7b4e4a21eab168a7",
      "relationship" : 2,
      "do_default_content_merge" : true
    }
  ]
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content.

If you try to add an invalid or redundant relationship, for instance setting files that are already duplicates as potential duplicates, no changes are made.

This is the file relationships request that is probably most likely to change in future. I may implement content merge options. I may move from file pairs to group identifiers. When I expand alternates, those file groups are going to support more variables.

#### king merge rules

Recall in `/get_file_relationships` that we discussed how duplicate groups have a 'king' for their best file. This file is the most useful representative when you do comparisons, since if you say "King A > King B", then we know that King A is also better than all of King B's normal duplicate group members. We can merge the group simply just by folding King B and all the other members into King A's group.

So what happens if you say 'A = B'? We have to have a king, so which should it be?

What happens if you say "non-king member of A > non-king member of B"? We don't want to merge all of B into A, since King B might be higher quality than King A.

The logic here can get tricky, but I have tried my best to avoid overcommitting and accidentally promoting the wrong king. Here are all the possible situations ('>' means 'better than', and '=' means 'same quality as'):

??? abstract "Merges" 
    * King A > King B  
        * Merge B into A
        * King A is king of the new combined group
    * Non-King A > King B
        * Merge B into A
        * King of A is king of the new combined group
    * King A > Non-King B
        * Remove Non-King B from B and merge it into A
        * King A stays king of A
        * King of B stays king of B
    * Non-King A > Non-King B
        * Remove Non-King B from B and merge it into A
        * King of A stays king of A
        * King of B stays king of B
    * King A = King B
        * Merge B into A
        * King A is king of the new combined group
    * Non-King A = King B
        * Merge B into A
        * King of A is king of the new combined group
    * King A = Non-King B
        * Merge A into B
        * King of B is king of the new combined group
    * Non-King A = Non-King B
        * Remove Non-King B from B and merge it into A
        * King of A stays king of A
        * King of B stays king of B

So, if you can, always present kings to your users, and action using those kings' hashes. It makes the merge logic easier in all cases. Remember that you can set `system:is the best quality file of its duplicate group` in any file search to exclude any non-kings (e.g. if you are hunting for easily actionable pixel potential duplicates).

### **POST `/manage_file_relationships/set_kings`** { id="manage_file_relationships_set_kings" }

Set the specified files to be the kings of their duplicate groups.

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage File Relationships permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   [files](#parameters_files)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "file_id" : 123
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content.

The files will be promoted to be the kings of their respective duplicate groups. If the file is already the king (also true for any file with no duplicates), this is idempotent. It also processes the files in the given order, so if you specify two files in the same group, the latter will be the king at the end of the request.

## Managing Services

For now, this refers to just seeing and committing pending content (which you see in the main "pending" menubar if you have an IPFS, Tag Repository, or File Repository service).

### **GET `/manage_services/get_pending_counts`** { id="manage_services_get_pending_counts" }

_Get the counts of pending content for each upload-capable service. This basically lets you construct the "pending" menu in the main GUI menubar._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Start Upload permission needed.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments: n/a

``` title="Example request"
/manage_services/get_pending_counts
```

Response:
:   A JSON Object of all the service keys capable of uploading and their current pending content counts. Also [The Services Object](#services_object).

```json title="Example response"
{
  "services" : "The Services Object",
  "pending_counts" : {
    "ae91919b0ea95c9e636f877f57a69728403b65098238c1a121e5ebf85df3b87e" :  {
      "pending_tag_mappings" : 11564,
      "petitioned_tag_mappings" : 5,
      "pending_tag_siblings" : 2,
      "petitioned_tag_siblings" : 0,
      "pending_tag_parents" : 0,
      "petitioned_tag_parents" : 0
    },
    "3902aabc3c4c89d1b821eaa9c011be3047424fd2f0c086346e84794e08e136b0" :  {
      "pending_tag_mappings" : 0,
      "petitioned_tag_mappings" : 0,
      "pending_tag_siblings" : 0,
      "petitioned_tag_siblings" : 0,
      "pending_tag_parents" : 0,
      "petitioned_tag_parents" : 0
    },
    "e06e1ae35e692d9fe2b83cde1510a11ecf495f51910d580681cd60e6f21fde73" : {
      "pending_files" : 2,
      "petitioned_files" : 0
    }
  }
}
```

The keys are as in [/get\_services](#get_services).

Each count here represents one 'row' of content, so for "tag_mappings" that is one (tag, file) pair and for "tag_siblings" one (tag, tag) pair. You always get everything, even if the counts are all 0.

### **POST `/manage_services/commit_pending`** { id="manage_services_commit_pending" }

_Start the job to upload a service's pending content._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Start Upload permission needed.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
*   `service_key`: (the service to commit)

``` title="Example request body"
{
    "service_key" : "ae91919b0ea95c9e636f877f57a69728403b65098238c1a121e5ebf85df3b87e"
}
```

This starts the upload popup, just like if you click 'commit' in the menu. This upload could ultimately take one second or several minutes to finish, but the response will come back immediately.

If the job is already running, this will return 409. If it cannot start because of a difficult problem, like all repositories being paused or the service account object being unsynced or something, it gives 422; in this case, please direct the user to check their client manually, since there is probably an error popup on screen. 

If tracking the upload job's progress is important, you could hit it again and see if it gives 409, or you could [/get\_pending\_counts](#manage_services_get_pending_counts) again--since the counts will update live as the upload happens--but note that the user may pend more just after the upload is complete, so do not wait forever for it to fall back down to 0.

### **POST `/manage_services/forget_pending`** { id="manage_services_forget_pending" }

_Forget all pending content for a service._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Start Upload permission needed.

Required Headers: n/a

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
*   `service_key`: (the service to forget for)

``` title="Example request body"
{
    "service_key" : "ae91919b0ea95c9e636f877f57a69728403b65098238c1a121e5ebf85df3b87e"
}
```

This clears all pending content for a service, just like if you click 'forget' in the menu.

Response description:
:  200 and no content.

## Managing Cookies

This refers to the cookies held in the client's session manager, which you can review under _network->data->manage session cookies_. These are sent to every request on the respective domains.

### **GET `/manage_cookies/get_cookies`** { id="manage_cookies_get_cookies" }

_Get the cookies for a particular domain._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Cookies and Headers permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments:
:   *  `domain`

``` title="Example request"
/manage_cookies/get_cookies?domain=somebooru.org
```

Response:
:   A JSON Object listing all the cookies for that domain in \[ name, value, domain, path, expires \] format.

```json title="Example response"
{
	"cookies" : [
		["__cfduid", "f1bef65041e54e93110a883360bc7e71", ".somebooru.org", "/", 1596223327],
		["pass_hash", "0b0833b797f108e340b315bc5463c324", "somebooru.org", "/", 1585855361],
		["user_id", "123456", "somebooru.org", "/", 1585855361]
	]
}
```

    Note that these variables are all strings except 'expires', which is either an integer timestamp or _null_ for session cookies.

    This request will also return any cookies for subdomains. The session system in hydrus generally stores cookies according to the second-level domain, so if you request for specific.someoverbooru.net, you will still get the cookies for someoverbooru.net and all its subdomains.

### **POST `/manage_cookies/set_cookies`** { id="manage_cookies_set_cookies" }

Set some new cookies for the client. This makes it easier to 'copy' a login from a web browser or similar to hydrus if hydrus's login system can't handle the site yet.

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Cookies and Headers permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `cookies`: (a list of cookie rows in the same format as the GET request above)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "cookies" : [
    ["PHPSESSID", "07669eb2a1a6e840e498bb6e0799f3fb", ".somesite.com", "/", 1627327719],
    ["tag_filter", "1", ".somesite.com", "/", 1627327719]
  ]
}
```

You can set 'value' to be null, which will clear any existing cookie with the corresponding name, domain, and path (acting essentially as a delete).

Expires can be null, but session cookies will time-out in hydrus after 60 minutes of non-use.

## Managing HTTP Headers

This refers to the custom headers you can see under _network->data->manage http headers_.

### **GET `/manage_headers/get_headers`** { id="manage_headers_get_headers" }

Get the custom http headers.

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Cookies and Headers permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments:
:   *  `domain`: optional, the domain to fetch headers for

``` title="Example request"
/manage_headers/get_headers?domain=somebooru.com
```

``` title="Example request (for global)"
/manage_headers/get_headers
```

Response:
:   A JSON Object listing all the headers:

```json title="Example response"
{
  "network_context" : {
    "type" : 2,
    "data" : "somebooru.org"
  },
  "headers" : {
    "User-Agent" : {
      "value" : "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0",
      "approved" : "approved",
      "reason" : "Set by Client API"
    },
    "DNT" : {
      "value" : "1",
      "approved" : "approved",
      "reason" : "Set by Client API"
    }
  }
}
```

### **POST `/manage_headers/set_headers`** { id="manage_headers_set_headers" }

Manages the custom http headers.

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Cookies and Headers permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:    
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:       
    *   `domain`: (optional, the specific domain to set the header for)
    *   `headers`: (a JSON Object that holds "key" objects)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "domain" : "mysite.com",
  "headers" : {
    "User-Agent" : {
      "value" : "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0"
    },
    "DNT" : {
      "value" : "1"
    },
    "CoolStuffToken" : {
      "value" : "abcdef0123456789",
      "approved" : "pending",
      "reason" : "This unlocks the Sonic fanfiction!"
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Example request body that deletes"
{
  "domain" : "myothersite.com",
  "headers" : {
    "User-Agent" : {
      "value" : null
    },
    "Authorization" : {
      "value" : null
    }
  }
}
```

If you do not set a domain, or you set it to `null`, the 'context' will be the global context, which applies as a fallback to all jobs.

Domain headers also apply to their subdomains--unless they are overwritten by specific subdomain entries.

Each `key` Object under `headers` has the same form as [/manage\_headers/get\_headers](#manage_headers_get_headers). `value` is obvious--it is the value of the header. If the pair doesn't exist yet, you need the `value`, but if you just want to approve something, it is optional. Set it to `null` to delete an existing pair.

You probably won't ever use `approved` or `reason`, but they plug into the 'validation' system in the client. They are both optional. Approved can be any of `[ approved, denied, pending ]`, and by default everything you add will be `approved`. If there is anything `pending` when a network job asks, the user will be presented with a yes/no popup presenting the reason for the header. If they click 'no', the header is set to `denied` and the network job goes ahead without it. If you have a header that changes behaviour or unlocks special content, you might like to make it optional in this way.

If you need to reinstate it, the default `global` `User-Agent` is `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Hydrus Client)`.

### **POST `/manage_headers/set_user_agent`** { id="manage_headers_set_user_agent" }

_This is deprecated--move to [/manage\_headers/set\_headers](#manage_headers_set_headers)!_

This sets the 'Global' User-Agent for the client, as typically editable under _network->data->manage http headers_, for instance if you want hydrus to appear as a specific browser associated with some cookies.

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Cookies and Headers permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:    
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:       
    *   `user-agent`: (a string)

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "user-agent" : "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0"
}
```

Send an empty string to reset the client back to the default User-Agent, which should be `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Hydrus Client)`.

## Managing Pages

This refers to the pages of the main client UI.

### **GET `/manage_pages/get_pages`** { id="manage_pages_get_pages" }

_Get the page structure of the current UI session._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Pages permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments: n/a
    

Response:

}
```

`name` is the full text on the page tab. 

`page_key` is a unique identifier for the page. It will stay the same for a particular page throughout the session, but new ones are generated on a session reload.

`page_type` is as follows:

*   1 - Gallery downloader
*   2 - Simple downloader
*   3 - Hard drive import
*   5 - Petitions (used by repository janitors)
*   6 - File search
*   7 - URL downloader
*   8 - Duplicates
*   9 - Thread watcher
*   10 - Page of pages

`page_state` is as follows:

* 0 - ready
* 1 - initialising
* 2 - searching/loading
* 3 - search cancelled

Most pages will be 0, normal/ready, at all times. Large pages will start in an 'initialising' state for a few seconds, which means their session-saved thumbnails aren't loaded yet. Search pages will enter 'searching' after a refresh or search change and will either return to 'ready' when the search is complete, or fall to 'search cancelled' if the search was interrupted (usually this means the user clicked the 'stop' button that appears after some time). 

`is_media_page` is simply a shorthand for whether the page is a normal page that holds thumbnails or a 'page of pages'. Only media pages can have files (and accept [/manage\_files/add\_files](#manage_pages_add_files) commands).

`selected` means which page is currently in view. It will propagate down the page of pages until it terminates. It may terminate in an empty page of pages, so do not assume it will end on a media page.    

The top page of pages will always be there, and always selected.


### **GET `/manage_pages/get_page_info`** { id="manage_pages_get_page_info" }

_Get information about a specific page._

!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This is under construction. The current call dumps a ton of info for different downloader pages. Please experiment in IRL situations and give feedback for now! I will flesh out this help with more enumeration info and examples as this gets nailed down. POST commands to alter pages (adding, removing, highlighting), will come later.

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Pages permission needed.
    
Required Headers: n/a
    
Arguments:
:   
    *   `page_key`: (hexadecimal page\_key as stated in [/manage\_pages/get\_pages](#manage_pages_get_pages))
    *   `simple`: true or false (optional, defaulting to true)

    }
  },
  "media" : {
    "num_files" : 4

}
```

`name`, `page_key`, `page_state`, and `page_type` are as in [/manage\_pages/get\_pages](#manage_pages_get_pages).

As you can see, even the 'simple' mode can get very large. Imagine that response for a page watching 100 threads! Turning simple mode off will display every import item, gallery log entry, and all hashes in the media (thumbnail) panel.

For this first version, the five importer pages--hdd import, simple downloader, url downloader, gallery page, and watcher page--all give rich info based on their specific variables. The first three only have one importer/gallery log combo, but the latter two of course can have multiple. The "imports" and "gallery_log" entries are all in the same data format.

### **POST `/manage_pages/add_files`** { id="manage_pages_add_files" }

_Add files to a page._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Pages permission needed.

Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `page_key`: (the page key for the page you wish to add files to)
    *   [files](#parameters_files)

The files you set will be appended to the given page, just like a thumbnail drag and drop operation. The page key is the same as fetched in the [/manage\_pages/get\_pages](#manage_pages_get_pages) call.

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "page_key" : "af98318b6eece15fef3cf0378385ce759bfe056916f6e12157cd928eb56c1f18",
  "file_ids" : [123, 124, 125]
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content. If the page key is not found, it will 404. If you try to add files to a 'page of pages' (i.e. `is_media_page=false` in the [/manage\_pages/get\_pages](#manage_pages_get_pages) call), you'll get 400.

### **POST `/manage_pages/focus_page`** { id="manage_pages_focus_page" }

_'Show' a page in the main GUI, making it the current page in view. If it is already the current page, no change is made._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Pages permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `page_key`: (the page key for the page you wish to show)

The page key is the same as fetched in the [/manage\_pages/get\_pages](#manage_pages_get_pages) call.

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "page_key" : "af98318b6eece15fef3cf0378385ce759bfe056916f6e12157cd928eb56c1f18"
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content. If the page key is not found, this will 404.
    

### **POST `/manage_pages/refresh_page`** { id="manage_pages_refresh_page" }

_Refresh a page in the main GUI. Like hitting F5 in the client, this obviously makes file search pages perform their search again, but for other page types it will force the currently in-view files to be re-sorted._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Pages permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `page_key`: (the page key for the page you wish to refresh)

The page key is the same as fetched in the [/manage\_pages/get\_pages](#manage_pages_get_pages) call. If a file search page is not set to 'searching immediately', a 'refresh' command does nothing.

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "page_key" : "af98318b6eece15fef3cf0378385ce759bfe056916f6e12157cd928eb56c1f18"
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content. If the page key is not found, this will 404.

Poll the `page_state` in [/manage\_pages/get\_pages](#manage_pages_get_pages) or [/manage\_pages/get\_page\_info](#manage_pages_get_page_info) to see when the search is complete.


## Managing Popups

!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This is under construction. The popup managment APIs and data structures may change in future versions.

### Job Status Objects { id="job_status_objects" }

Job statuses represent shared information about a job in hydrus. In the API they are currently only used for popups.

Job statuses have these fields:

- `key`: the generated hex key identifying the job status
- `creation_time`: the UNIX timestamp when the job status was created, as a floating point number in seconds.
- `status_title`: the title for the job status
- `status_text_1` and `status_text_2`: Two fields for body text
- `had_error`: a boolean indiciating if the job status has an error.
- `traceback`: if the job status has an error this will contain the traceback text.
- `is_cancellable`: a boolean indicating the job can be canceled.
- `is_cancelled`: a boolean indicating the job has been cancelled. 
- `is_deleted`: a boolean indicating the job status has been dismissed but not removed yet.
- `is_pausable`: a boolean indicating the job can be paused
- `is_paused`: a boolean indicating the job is paused.
- `is_working`: a boolean indicating whether the job is currently working.
- `nice_string`: a string representing the job status. This is generated using the `status_title`, `status_text_1`, `status_text_2`, and `traceback` if present.
- `attached_files_mergable`: a boolean indicating whether the files in the job status can be merged with the files of another submitted job status with the same label.
- `popup_gauge_1` and `popup_gauge_2`: each of these is a 2 item array of numbers representing a progress bar shown in the client. The first number is the current value and the second is the maximum of the range. The minimum is always 0. When using these in combination with the `status_text` fields they are shown in this order: `status_text_1`, `popup_gauge_1`, `status_text_2`, `popup_gauge_2`.
- `api_data`: an arbitrary object for use by API clients.
- `files`: an object representing the files attached to this job status, shown as a button in the client that opens a search page for the given hashes. It has these fields:
    - `hashes`: an array of sha256 hashes.
    - `label`: the label for the show files button.
- `user_callable_label`: if the job status has a user callable function this will be the label for the button that triggers it.
- `network_job`: An object represneting the current network job. It has these fields:
    - `url`: the url being downloaded.
    - `waiting_on_connection_error`: boolean
    - `domain_ok`: boolean
    - `waiting_on_serverside_bandwidth`: boolean
    - `no_engine_yet`: boolean
    - `has_error`: boolean
    - `total_data_used`: integer number of bytes
    - `is_done`: boolean
    - `status_text`: string
    - `current_speed`: integer number of bytes per second
    - `bytes_read`: integer number of bytes
    - `bytes_to_read`: integer number of bytes

All fields other than `key` and `creation_time` are optional and will only be returned if they're set.

### **POST `/manage_popups/add_popup`** { id="manage_popups_add_popuip" }

_Add a popup._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Popups permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   it accepts these fields of a [job status object](#job_status_objects):
        *   `is_cancellable`
        *   `is_pausable`
        *   `attached_files_mergable`
        *   `status_title`
        *   `status_text_1` and `status_text_2`
        *   `popup_gauge_1` and `popup_gauge_2`
        *   `api_data`
        *   `files_label`: the label for the files attached to the job status. It will be returned as `label` in the `files` object in the [job status object](#job_status_objects).
        *   [files](#parameters_files) that will be added to the job status. They will be returned as `hashes` in the `files` object in the [job status object](#job_status_objects). `files_label` is required to add files.

A new job status will be created and submitted as a popup. Set a `status_title` on bigger ongoing jobs that will take a while and receive many updates--and leave it alone, even when the job is done. For simple notes, just set `status_text_1`.

!!! danger "Finishing Jobs"
    The pausable, cancellable, and files-mergable status of a job is only settable at creation. A pausable or cancellable popup represents an ongoing and unfinished job. The popup will exist indefinitely and will not be user-dismissable unless the user can first cancel it.
    
    **You, as the creator, _must_ plan to call Finish once your work is done. Yes, even if there is an error!**

!!! note "Pausing and Cancelling"
    If the user pauses a job, you should recognise that and pause your work. Resume when they do.
    
    If the user cancels a job, you should recognise that and stop work. Either call `finish` with an appropriate status update, or `finish_and_dismiss` if you have nothing more to say.
    
    If your long-term job has a main loop, place this at the top of the loop, along with your status update calls.

{
  "status_text_1": "Note to user"

### **POST `/manage_popups/cancel_popup`** { id="manage_popups_cancel_popup" }

_Try to cancel a popup._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Popups permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `job_status_key`: The job status key to cancel 

The job status must be cancellable to be cancelled. If it isn't, this is nullipotent.

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "job_status_key" : "abee8b37d47dba8abf82638d4afb1d11586b9ef7be634aeb8ae3bcb8162b2c86"
}
```

### **POST `/manage_popups/dismiss_popup`** { id="manage_popups_dismiss_popup" }

_Try to dismiss a popup._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Popups permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `job_status_key`: The job status key to dismiss 

This is a call an 'observer' (i.e. not the job creator) makes. In the client UI, it would be a user right-clicking a popup to dismiss it. If the job is dismissable (i.e. it `is_done`), the popup disappears, but if it is pausable/cancellable--an ongoing job--then this action is nullipotent.

You should call this on jobs you did not create yourself.

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "job_status_key": "abee8b37d47dba8abf82638d4afb1d11586b9ef7be634aeb8ae3bcb8162b2c86"
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content.


### **POST `/manage_popups/finish_popup`** { id="manage_popups_finish_popup" }

_Mark a popup as done._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Popups permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `job_status_key`: The job status key to finish 

!!! danger "Important"
    **You may only call this on jobs you created yourself.**

You only need to call it on jobs that you created pausable or cancellable. It clears those statuses, sets `is_done`, and allows the user to dismiss the job with a right-click.

Once called, the popup will remain indefinitely. You should marry this call with an `update` that clears the texts and gauges you were using and leaves a "Done, processed x files with y errors!" or similar statement to let the user know how the job went. 

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "job_status_key" : "abee8b37d47dba8abf82638d4afb1d11586b9ef7be634aeb8ae3bcb8162b2c86"
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content.


### **POST `/manage_popups/finish_and_dismiss_popup`** { id="manage_popups_finish_and_dismiss_popup" }

_Finish and dismiss a popup._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Popups permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `job_status_key`: The job status key to dismiss
    *   `seconds`: (optional) an integer number of seconds to wait before dismissing the job status, defaults to happening immediately 

!!! danger "Important"
    **You may only call this on jobs you created yourself.**

This will call `finish` immediately and flag the message for auto-dismissal (i.e. removing it from the popup toaster) either immediately or after the given number of seconds.

You would want this instead of just `finish` for when you either do not need to leave a 'Done!' summary, or if the summary is not so important, and is only needed if the user happens to glance that way. If you did boring work for ten minutes, you might like to set a simple 'Done!' and auto-dismiss after thirty seconds or so. 

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "job_status_key": "abee8b37d47dba8abf82638d4afb1d11586b9ef7be634aeb8ae3bcb8162b2c86",
  "seconds": 5
}
```

Response:
:   200 with no content.


### **POST `/manage_popups/update_popup`** { id="manage_popups_update_popuip" }

_Update a popup._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Popups permission needed.
    
Required Headers:
:   
    *   `Content-Type`: application/json

Arguments (in JSON):
:   
    *   `job_status_key`: The hex key of the job status to update.
    *   It accepts these fields of a [job status object](#job_status_objects):
        *   `status_title`
        *   `status_text_1` and `status_text_2`
        *   `popup_gauge_1` and `popup_gauge_2`
        *   `api_data`
        *   `files_label`: the label for the files attached to the job status. It will be returned as `label` in the `files` object in the [job status object](#job_status_objects).
        *   [files](#parameters_files) that will be added to the job status. They will be returned as `hashes` in the `files` object in the [job status object](#job_status_objects). `files_label` is required to add files.

The specified job status will be updated with the new values submitted. Any field without a value will be left alone and any field set to `null` will be removed from the job status.

```json title="Example request body"
{
  "job_status_key": "abee8b37d47dba8abf82638d4afb1d11586b9ef7be634aeb8ae3bcb8162b2c86",
  "status_title": "Example Popup",
  "status_text_1": null,
  "popup_gauge_1": [12, 120],
  "api_data": {
    "whatever": "other stuff"
  }
}
```

Response:
:   A JSON Object containing `job_status`, the [job status object](#job_status_objects) that was updated.


## Managing the Database

### **POST `/manage_database/force_commit`** { id="manage_database_force_commit" }

_Force the database to write all pending changes to disk immediately._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Database permission needed.

Arguments: None

!!! info
    Hydrus holds a constant `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction on its database. Separate jobs are 'transactionalised' using `SAVEPOINT`, and the real transactions are only `COMMIT`-ed to disk every 30 seconds or so. Thus, if the client crashes, a user can lose up to 30 seconds of changes (or more, if they use the launch path to extend the inter-transaction duration).

This command lets you force a `COMMIT` as soon as possible. The request will only return when the commit is done and finished, so you can trust when this returns 200 OK that you are in the clear and everything is saved. If the database is currently disconnected (e.g. there is a vacuum going on), then it returns very fast, but you can typically expect it to take a handful of milliseconds. If there is a normal database job already happening when you call, it will `COMMIT` when that is complete, and if things are really busy (e.g. amidst idle-time repository processing) then there could be hundreds of megabytes to write. This job may, when the database is under strain, take ten or more seconds to complete.

Response:
:   200 with no content.

### **POST `/manage_database/lock_on`** { id="manage_database_lock_on" }

_Pause the client's database activity and disconnect the current connection._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Database permission needed.

Arguments: None

This is a hacky prototype. It commands the client database to pause its job queue and release its connection (and related file locks and journal files). This puts the client in a similar position as a long VACUUM command--it'll hang in there, but not much will work, and since the UI async code isn't great yet, the UI may lock up after a minute or two. If you would like to automate database backup without shutting the client down, this is the thing to play with.

This should return pretty quick, but it will wait up to five seconds for the database to actually disconnect. If there is a big job (like a VACUUM) current going on, it may take substantially longer to finish that up and process this STOP command. You might like to check for the existence of a journal file in the db dir just to be safe.

As long as this lock is on, all Client API calls except the unlock command will return 503. (This is a decent way to test the current lock status, too)

Response:
:   200 with no content.

### **POST `/manage_database/lock_off`** { id="manage_database_lock_off" }

_Reconnect the client's database and resume activity._

Restricted access: 
:   YES. Manage Database permission needed.

Arguments: None

This is the obvious complement to the lock. The client will resume processing its job queue and will catch up. If the UI was frozen, it should free up in a few seconds, just like after a big VACUUM.

Response:
:   200 with no content.

### **GET `/manage_database/mr_bones`** { id="manage_database_mr_bones" }

_Get the data from help->how boned am I?. This is a simple Object of numbers just for hacky advanced purposes if you want to build up some stats in the background. The numbers are the same as the dialog shows, so double check that to confirm what means what._

Restricted access:
:   YES. Manage Database permission needed.

Arguments (in percent-encoded JSON):
:   
    *   `tags`: (optional, a list of tags you wish to search for)
    *   [file domain](#parameters_file_domain) (optional, defaults to _all my files_)
    *   `tag_service_key`: (optional, hexadecimal, the tag domain on which to search, defaults to _all my files_)
    
    ``` title="Example requests"
    /manage_database/mr_bones
    /manage_database/mr_bones?tags=%5B%22blonde_hair%22%2C%20%22blue_eyes%22%5D
    ```

```json title="Example response"
{
  "boned_stats" : {
    "num_inbox" : 8356,
    "num_archive" : 229,
    "num_deleted" : 7010,
    "size_inbox" : 7052596762,
    "size_archive" : 262911007,
    "size_deleted" : 13742290193,
    "earliest_import_time" : 1451408539,
    "total_viewtime" : [3280, 41621, 2932, 83021],
    "total_alternate_files" : 265,
    "total_alternate_groups" : 63,
    "total_duplicate_files" : 125,
    "total_potential_pairs" : 3252
  }
}
```

The arguments here are the same as for [GET /get\_files/search\_files](#get_files_search_files). You can set any or none of them to set a search domain like in the dialog.

### **GET `/manage_database/get_client_options`** { id="manage_database_get_client_options" }
