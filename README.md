## Hydrus Network (Client and Server)

The hydrus network client is an application written for Anon and other internet-fluent media nerds who have large image/swf/webm collections. It browses with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Advanced users can share tags and files anonymously through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free and privacy is the first concern. Executable releases are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The program is in python, so you can also run it straight from the source code.

I am continually working on the software and try to put out a new release every Wednesday by 8pm EST.

This github repository is currently a weekly sync with my home dev environment, where I work on hydrus by myself. **Feel free to fork and do whatever you like with my code, but please do not make pull requests.** The [issue tracker here on Github](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/issues) is active and run by blessed volunteer users. I am not active here on Github, and I have difficulty keeping up with social media in general, but I welcome feedback of any sort and will eventually catch up with and reply to email, twitter @s/DMs, discord @s/DMs, or posts in the 8chan or Endchan release threads.

## Start Here!

**[Getting Started Guide](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/introduction.html)**

This help will walk you through installation and teach you the main systems of the program. Hydrus can do a lot, so while you can skim it, do not skip it. 

The help is also included in every release.
