## Hydrus Network (Client and Server)

The hydrus network client is an application written for Anon and other internet-fluent media nerds who have large image/swf/webm collections. It browses with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Advanced users can share tags and files anonymously through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, privacy is the first concern, and the source code is included with the release. Releases are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

I am continually working on the software and try to put out a new release every Wednesday by 8pm EST.

This github repository is currently a weekly sync with my home dev environment, where I work on hydrus by myself. **Feel free to fork and do whatever you like with my code, but please do not make pull requests.** The [issue tracker here on Github](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/issues) is active and run by blessed volunteer users. I am not active here on Github, and I have difficulty keeping up with social media in general, but I welcome feedback of any sort and will eventually catch up with and reply to email, the 8kun or Endchan boards, tumblr, twitter, or the discord.

The client can do quite a lot! Please check out the help inside the release or [here](http://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/help), which includes a comprehensive getting started guide.
