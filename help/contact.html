			<h3>contact and links</h3>
			<p>Please send me all your bug reports, questions, ideas, and comments. It is always interesting to see how other people are using my software, and what they generally think. Most of the changes every week are suggested by users.</p>
			<p>Please contact me by email, twitter, tumblr, or the 8chan board--I do not mind which. I'm not active on github. I often like to spend a day or so to think before replying to non-urgent messages, but I do try to reply to everything.</p>
			<p>I delete all tweets and resolved email conversations after three months. So, if you think you are waiting for a reply, or I said I was going to work on something you care about and seem to have forgotten, please do nudge me.</p>
			<p>If you have a problem with something on someone else's server, please, <span class="warning">do not come to me</span>, as I cannot help. If your ex-gf's nudes have leaked onto the internet or you just find something terribly offensive, I cannot help you at all.</p>
			<p>Anyway:</p>
