			<p>I welcome all your bug reports, questions, ideas, and comments. It is always interesting to see how other people are using my software and what they generally think of it. Most of the changes every week are suggested by users.</p>
			<p>You can contact me by email, twitter, tumblr, discord, or the 8chan.moe /t/ thread or Endchan board--I do not mind which. Please know that I have difficulty with social media, and while I try to reply to all messages, it sometimes takes me a while to catch up.</p>
			<p>The <a href="https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/issues">Github Issue Tracker</a> was turned off for some time, as it did not fit my workflow and I could not keep up, but it is now running again, managed by a team of volunteer users. Please feel free to submit feature requests there if you are comfortable with Github. I am not socially active on Github, and it is mostly just a mirror of my home dev environment, where I work alone.</p>
			<p>I am on the discord on Saturday afternoon, USA time, if you would like to talk live, and briefly on Wednesday after I put the release out. If that is not a good time for you, feel free to leave me a DM and I will get to you when I can. There are also plenty of other hydrus users who idle who would be happy to help with any sort of support question.</p>
			<p>I delete all tweets and resolved email conversations after three months. So, if you think you are waiting for a reply, or I said I was going to work on something you care about and seem to have forgotten, please do nudge me.</p>
			<p>Anyway:</p>
