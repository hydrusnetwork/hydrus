				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 248</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed two more issues with recent update code!</li>
					<li>re-applied a more rigorously tested 'invalid subtag' replacement for any user that has experienced incomplete update code in the past few weeks</li>
					<li>added some tag rendering options to options->tags that affect most user-facing, non-editing windows:</li>
					<li>added custom namespace-subtag connector (i.e. instead of ':')</li>
					<li>added 'show namespaces' checkbox (i.e. to keep the colour but lose the namespace, like how most boorus display tags)</li>
					<li>created a basic framework for the duplicate filter--it doesn't do anything yet, but you can launch it from the duplicates page to check it out</li>
					<li>updated 'reset processing cache' action and added it to review services repository pages</li>
					<li>review services now always starts on 'my files'</li>
					<li>review services will try to stay looking at the currently selected service through a refresh_services event</li>
					<li>fixed some thread-gui refresh interaction in review services</li>
					<li>all listctrl-attached delete/remove buttons will now ask if you are sure before they go</li>
					<li>reenabled db->maintenance->clear orphans, which it turns out I had already fixed by accident</li>
					<li>serverside services will lock themselves more efficiently while generating updates, ensuring 'server busy' responses can always return promptly</li>
					<li>fixed tag manage parents a/c entry to remove tags when they already exist in the box (previously, the a/c would only ever add, so a double-click was required to remove)</li>
					<li>tuned adminside petition processing so it approves/denies in reasonable-sized chunks</li>
					<li>refactored all the taglist gui code to focus on the underlying tag rather than the string representation</li>
					<li>plenty of misc taglist cleanup besides</li>
					<li>started a unit test suite for listboxes and wrote a thorough test for namespace colour listbox</li>
					<li>misc canvas refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 247</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed a problem with deleting more than 256 files at once</li>
					<li>furthermore, deleting from thumbnail view or after a filter will split delete jobs into chunks of 64 files at a time to reduce gui hang from deleting many tag-heavy files</li>
					<li>rewrote canvas media container code to recycle containers, embed windows, animation bars, static image windows, and animation windows. scrolling through all kinds of media is less flickery (less 'grey box' window initialise flicker) and scrolling through static images should be completely flickerless! William Gibson slideshow speed works again!</li>
					<li>this flickerless static image transition will be particularly useful in the forthcoming duplicate image filter!</li>
					<li>got adminside petition processing working again</li>
					<li>petition counts and fetching is now split by content_type and status</li>
					<li>the approve/deny colour hint is more obvious on the petition panel</li>
					<li>petitions now process off the main gui thread and throw up a popup message</li>
					<li>added 'check all' and 'check none' buttons to petition panel</li>
					<li>several serverside petition processing fixes</li>
					<li>generalised and improved dynamic menu check item initialisation and inversion support</li>
					<li>moved the 'get tags even if file already in db' option into a cog button on regular downloader pages</li>
					<li>added a default menu option for 'get tags even if file already in db' to the same cog button</li>
					<li>added this cog button to the edit subscription panel as well</li>
					<li>fixed exporting tags to Hydrus Tag Archives</li>
					<li>fixed exporting 'all known tags' to HTAs</li>
					<li>cleaned some HTA and related code</li>
					<li>fixed namespace based tag censorship</li>
					<li>fixed autocomplete not filtering out current/pending counts if they are set to 'excluded'</li>
					<li>fixed generation of non-expiring new accounts</li>
					<li>fixed some v245->v246 tag improvement code that was replacing invalid tags with the incorrect namespace</li>
					<li>patched a problem with '-:' dirty tag in the v245->v246 update code--I'm not sure what it was doing, but it catches the unusual problem and puts it in the 'invalid tags' category, so let me know if you get trouble with this in future</li>
					<li>wrote unit tests for bytesdictionary and shortcuts serialisable objects</li>
					<li>harmonised and improved how separators are appended to menus</li>
					<li>cleaned up some client db index creation</li>
					<li>cleaned up some client tuple stripping</li>
					<li>misc pylint warnings cleanup</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 246</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed a critical bug in serverside content deserialisating that meant servers were not processing most client-submitted data properly</li>
					<li>fixed a critical bug in 'all known tags' autocomplete regeneration--please run database->regen->a/c cache when it is convenient and let me know if your numbers are still off</li>
					<li>fixed the pre-v238 update problem for good by abandoning update attempts and advising users to try v238 first</li>
					<li>clientside invalid tags will now be collapsed like with the server last week. if a tag is invalid (typically something with an extra space, like "series: blah"), the update code will attempt to replace existing mappings with the collapsed valid version. some unusual cases may remain--they will be replaced with 'invalid namespace "series "' and similar. Please remove and replace these when convenient and contact me if there are way too many for you to deal with</li>
					<li>duplicates pages now have a file domain for the filtering section, and they remember this domain through session loads</li>
					<li>this file domain is accurate--counting potential duplicates and fetching pairs for 'show some pairs' only from those domains. the issue of remote files appearing should be gone!</li>
					<li>there is now only one 'idle' entry in the duplicates page cog menu--it combines the three previous into one</li>
					<li>fixed numerous irregularities across the wildcard code. all search input now has an implicit '*' on the end unless you put a '*' anywhere else, in which case it acts exactly as you enter it, with a non-* beginning matching beginning of string, whitespace, or colon, and non-* end matching end of string or whitespace</li>
					<li>autocomplete now searches namespace, so entering 'char' will load up all the 'character:' tags along with 'series:di gi charat'. this can lag to hell and back, so it may either need some work or be optional in the future. feedback would be appreciated</li>
					<li>typing 'namespace:' will include all the series tags below the special optimised 'namespace:*anything*' tag</li>
					<li>autocomplete searches recognise an explicit '*' no matter where it is in the entry text. typing 'a*' will load up all the a tags and present a 'a*' wildcard option</li>
					<li>quickly entering a wildcard entry will now submit the correct wildcard predicate ('rather than a literal 'hel*' or whatever tag)</li>
					<li>review services panel now reports total mappings info on tag services</li>
					<li>review services panel now reports total files info on file services</li>
					<li>manage services's listctrl is now type | name | deletable and initially sorts by type. the strings used for hydrus service types are also improved</li>
					<li>manage serverside services (called by server admins to manage their services) have fixed setnondupe port and name on edit service events</li>
					<li>new popup messages will now also appear if there were previously no popup messages to display if the current focus is on a child on_top frame, such as review services (you'll now see the processing popup appear when you click 'process now' on review services)</li>
					<li>the popup message manager now initialises its display window with a single message that is quickly dismissed. this helps set up some variables in a safe environment so they don't have to be generated later when the gui might be minimised or otherwise unusual</li>
					<li>hid hydrus update files from 'all local files' searches</li>
					<li>added 'media_view' entries for hydrus update files, just in case they are still visible in some unusual contexts (and they may be again in a future update anyway)</li>
					<li>fixed 'recent tags' being returned from the database out of order</li>
					<li>by default, 'recent tags' is now on for new users</li>
					<li>'get tags even if file already in db' now defaults to False</li>
					<li>file import status now allows a 'delete' action below the 'skip' action</li>
					<li>file import status right-click event processing is more sane</li>
					<li>fixed the new raw width/height sort choices, which were accidentally swapped</li>
					<li>cleaned the media sort code generally</li>
					<li>cleared out some redundant rows that are in some users' client_files_locations</li>
					<li>namespaced predicates are no longer count-merged with their namespaceless versions in 'write' autocomplete dropdowns</li>
					<li>'unknown' accounts should now properly resync after clientside service change</li>
					<li>improved how registration keys are checked serverside when fetching access keys</li>
					<li>fixed a v244 update problem when unexected additional tag parent/sibling petitions rows exist</li>
					<li>improved my free space test code and applied it to the old v243->v244 free space test (it'll now test free space on your temporary path and report problems appropriately)</li>
					<li>to improve log privacy and cleanliness, and to make it easier to report profiles, db/pubsub profiles now write to a separate log file named appropriately and labelled with the process's start time</li>
					<li>profiles are more concise and formatted a little neater</li>
					<li>across the program, three-period ... ellipses are now replaced with their single character unicode … counterpart (except to the console, where any instance of the unicode ellipsis will now be converted back to ...)</li>
					<li>cleaned up some log printing code</li>
					<li>cleaned up some experimental static serialisation code, still thinking if I like it or not</li>
					<li>started on some proper unit tests for hydrus serialisable objects</li>
					<li>fixed and otherwise updated a heap of unit test code to account for the v245 changes</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of old database table join code</li>
					<li>started some databse-query-tuple-stripping code cleaning</li>
					<li>deleted more old unused code</li>
					<li>misc timing improvements</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup experimentation</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 245</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed a v244 update problem for clients updating from <v238</li>
					<li>some misc stuff:</li>
					<li>if you start editing many subscriptions, cancelling a single dialog will break the chain of loading new dialogs</li>
					<li>reduced some redundancy in regular client file import</li>
					<li>improved how the dialog for selection from a list of strings works</li>
					<li>if the client ever merges one directory to another (such as in external file locations migration) and any files fail to merge, the source will no longer be deleted</li>
					<li>created new flexible bandwidth tracking and ruling objects</li>
					<li>updated how repository updates work, splitting the old explicit and self-contained content update package system to a new implicit definitions/content split system and an improved one-step-sync metadata propagation</li>
					<li>updating now takes approximately 23% as much bandwidth as before</li>
					<li>update files are now stored in client_files and server_files like any other file (client_updates and server_updates folders will be deleted on update)</li>
					<li>the server will print update generation info to its log</li>
					<li>unfortunately, updates cannot be converted, so a complete resync of update files is required. the smaller update size and better bandwidth controls should mitigate the problem somewhat</li>
					<li>the server has been compacted across all content types--its mappings db file should shrink about 12%</li>
					<li>due to new service-specific ids, server.master.db should increase in size, typically about 50%</li>
					<li>harmonised how GET and POST/response args are built and parsed across the network</li>
					<li>server administration initialisation is now simpler, done with 'init' registration key</li>
					<li>leading and trailing spaces are now removed from both the namespace and subtag components of namespaced tags, meaning 'title: blah' will be collapsed to 'title:blah'. tag repositories will clean their existing tags on update</li>
					<li>invalid serverside tags will be replaced with valid placeholders on server update</li>
					<li>refactored, harmonised and simplified some server request code</li>
					<li>Eris makes a triumphant return to the root welcome page ('/' request of any service) with improved self-description text as well</li>
					<li>updated how bandwidth is tracked and overseen</li>
					<li>all requests now consume bandwidth</li>
					<li>fewer requests are actually constrained by bandwidth--at the moment, it is only update files and file/thumbnail downloads, as these represent the overwhelming majority of bandwidth consumption and are not at all critical to service operation--this may change in the future, but it suits our purposes for now</li>
					<li>bandwidth tracking code is more sane across the board</li>
					<li>the server's administration service now tracks server-wide bandwidth as it happens</li>
					<li>service and server-wide bandwidth rules are consulted as soon as the request begins</li>
					<li>improved some server response rendering</li>
					<li>permissions are more flexible and content-specific</li>
					<li>improved how file repositories check and process file requests</li>
					<li>created a gui control for managing bandwidth rules</li>
					<li>updated the serverside service object</li>
					<li>the serverside service object now contains bandwidth rules and tracking</li>
					<li>updated how the server deals with services on a db level</li>
					<li>refactored and cleaned a ton of server db code</li>
					<li>updated how services are edited over the network</li>

					<li>updated gui code for clientside server service management</li>
					<li>converted clientside server service management db code to the new system</li>
					<li>improved how bandwidth errors are reported</li>
					<li>updated the account type object</li>
					<li>the account type object now contains bandwidth rules and a more flexible permissions system</li>
					<li>updated how the server deals with account types on a db level</li>
					<li>converted clientside server account type management gui to the new panel system</li>
					<li>updated gui code for clientside server account type management</li>
					<li>serverside account types are now fetched from a cache, reducing memory sprawl</li>
					<li>updated the account object</li>
					<li>the account object now contains a bandwidth tracker</li>
					<li>updated how the server deals with accounts on a db level</li>
					<li>updated the clientside server object</li>
					<li>the clientside server object now contains bandwidth rules and a tracker and has improved error management, recovery, and reporting</li>
					<li>updated how the client deals with services on a db level</li>
					<li>improved how serverside bandwidth errors are caught</li>
					<li>all clientside services start with a 50MB/day bandwidth limit</li>
					<li>existing repositories will get a 250MB/month, 50MB/day default bandwidth limit, just to help us get over the hump--see the release post for info on how to get all the updates anyway</li>
					<li>updated manage services dialog extensively</li>
					<li>service account registration now occurs through a simple button on the normal clientside service edit panel</li>
					<li>all services can now be renamed</li>
					<li>updated the content processing pipeline</li>
					<li>prepared code for future merging of file and tag repositories</li>
					<li>added future support for pend-petitions for files and mappings and simple creation permissions for tag siblings and parents</li>
					<li>the clientside content processing pipeline now operates inside a single database transaction, reducing a great deal of previously redundant hard drive activity</li>
					<li>the serverside content processing pipeline now creates per-service timestamped content definitions</li>
					<li>the clientside content processing pipeline now maintains and appropriately consults a cache for server definitions</li>
					<li>pre-process disk cache is more intelligent</li>
					<li>updated review services to match the new service objects</li>
					<li>service review panels now show more information about error state and so on</li>

					<li>for users with plenty of tags, the db should now be about 33% smaller!</li>
					<li>unified how unnamespaced tag searching counts are totalled</li>
					<li>unnamespaced tag searching counts are now totalled when the tags are fetched from the in-view ui media</li>
					<li>unified how tags are split into ( namespace, subtag ) across the program</li>
					<li>fixed deviantart gallery thumbnail parser</li>
					<li>fixed linux session load page key event handling bug</li>

					<li>misc efficiency improvements and general db code cleanup</li>
					<li>misc path code cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 243</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>updated more menu code to the new system</li>
					<li>finished updating all main gui menubar and thumbnail menu code</li>
					<li>all brackets, braces, parentheses, and single and double quotes are now ignored when matching search text to tag. inputting 'mercy' matches 'character:angela "mercy" ziegler' and entering '[[[intensifies]]]' matches '[intensifies]'</li>
					<li>'*' searches will now return no autocomplete results, rather than trying to load absolutely everything</li>
					<li>made wildcard searching significantly more permissable--it now implicitly applies a '*' to the beginning as well as the end of your search input</li>
					<li>the main gui's notebook pages will now be disabled while a session loads</li>
					<li>might have fixed a first-boot layout issue--otherwise added a layout entry to the debug menu for further testing of this problem</li>
					<li>improved progress layout on file import dialog</li>
					<li>created a more efficient way for threads to update gui elements</li>
					<li>the file import dialog uses this new update system and parses lots of small files much faster as a result</li>

					<li>ffmpeg mime parsing now catches and reports audio formats without any hassle</li>
					<li>thread downloader no longer fetches file extension in filename tag 'filename:blah' instead of 'filename:blah.jpg'</li>
					<li>changed png default zoom rules to copy jpg--the unusual zoom as default was more confusing than helpful</li>
					<li>updated sqlite for windows--should be a decent bit faster</li>
					<li>deleted a lot of old code that'll never be needed again</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 242</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>optimised 'exact match' similar file queries to run a lot faster</li>
					<li>optimised similar file queries in general, particularly for larger cycle queries</li>
					<li>optimised hamming distance calculation, decreasing time by roughly 45%!</li>
					<li>the similar files tree maintenance idle job will not trigger while there are phashes still to regenerate (this was redundantly and annoyingly blatting the new dupes page as soon as phash regen was paused)</li>
					<li>removed similar files tree maintenance entry from db->maintain menu, as it can be done better from the new dupes page</li>
					<li>adjusted the duplicate search and file phash regen progress gauges to reflect total number of files in cache, not the current batch job</li>
					<li>all maintenance jobs on the duplicates search page will now save their progress (and free up a hanging gui) every 30 seconds</li>
					<li>the duplicates page's cog menu button now lets you put phash regen and tree rebalancing on the normal idle routine, defaulting both to off</li>
					<li>the cog menu can also put duplicate searching on idle time!</li>
					<li>added a very rough 'just show me some pairs!' button to the dupe page--it is pretty neat to finally see what is going on</li>
					<li>I may have reduced the memory use explosion some users are getting during file phash regen maintenance</li>
					<li>wrote an unclose_page action and added it to the shortcuts options panel--it undoes the last page close, if one exists. ctrl+u will be the default for new users, but existing users have to add it under options</li>
					<li>added ascending/descending sort choices for width, height, ratio, and num_pixels</li>
					<li>the client can no longer talk to old http hydrus network servers--everything is now https</li>
					<li>in prep for a later network version update, the client now supports gzipped network strings (which compress json a lot better than the old lz4 compression)</li>
					<li>fixed gif rendering in the Windows build--I forgot to update a build script dll patch for the new version of opencv</li>
					<li>the export file dialog's neighbouring .txt taglist file stuff now allows you to select a specific combination of tag services</li>
					<li>if an hdd import's original file is due to be deleted, any existing neighbouring taglist .txt file will now also be deleted</li>
					<li>the inter-thread messaging system has a new simple way of reporting download progress on an url</li>
					<li>the handful of things that create a downloading popup (like the youtube downloader) now use this new download reporting system</li>
					<li>sankaku seems to be 503-broke due to cloudflare protection--I have paused all existing sankaku subscriptions and removed the sankaku entry for new users (pending a future fix on my or their end)</li>
					<li>I've also removed danbooru for new users for now--someone can fix the long-running sample size file issue in the new downloader engine</li>
					<li>removed unnamespaced tag support from the hentai-foundry parser--maybe someone can try to fix that mess in the new downloader engine</li>
					<li>menubuttons can now handle boolean check menu items that are tied straight into hydrus's options</li>
					<li>menus launched from the newer frame and dialog code will now correctly display their help text on the main gui frame's statusbar! (at least on Windows! Linux and OS X remain borked!)</li>
					<li>fixed a unicode error parsing bug in the gallery downloader</li>
					<li>the server stop (or restart) command now correctly uses https!</li>
					<li>the server test code now works on https as appropriate</li>
					<li>fixed some misc server test code</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
					<li>misc layout cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 241</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed the 'setnondupename' problem that was affecting 'add' actions on manage subscriptions, scripts, and import/export folders</li>
					<li>added some more tests to catch this problem automatically in future</li>
					<li>cleaned up some similar files phash regeneration logic</li>
					<li>cleaned up similar files maintenance code to deal with the new duplicates page</li>
					<li>wrote a similar files duplicate pair search maintenance routine</li>
					<li>activated file phash regen button on the new duplicates page</li>
					<li>activated branch rebalancing button on the new duplicates page</li>
					<li>activated duplicate search button on the new duplicates page</li>
					<li>search distance on the new duplicates page is now remembered between sessions</li>
					<li>improved the phash algorithm to use median instead of mean--it now gives fewer apparent false positives and negatives, but I think it may also be stricter in general</li>
					<li>the duplicate system now discards phashes for blank, flat colour images (this will be more useful when I reintroduce dupe checking for animations, which often start with a black frame)</li>
					<li>misc phash code cleanup</li>
					<li>all local jpegs and pngs will be scheduled for phash regeneration on update as their current phashes are legacies of several older versions of the algorithm</li>
					<li>debuted a cog menu button on the new duplicates page to refresh the page and reset found potential duplicate pairs--this cog should be making appearances elsewhere to add settings and reduce excess buttons</li>
					<li>improved some search logic that was refreshing too much info on an 'include current/pending tags' button press</li>
					<li>fixed pixiv login--for now!</li>
					<li>system:dimensions now catches an enter key event and passes it to the correct ok button, rather than always num_pixels</li>
					<li>fixed some bad http->https conversion when uploading files to file repo</li>
					<li>folder deletion will try to deal better with read-only nested files</li>
					<li>tag parent uploads will now go one at a time (rather than up to 100 as before) to reduce commit lag</li>
					<li>updated to python 2.7.13 for windows</li>

					<li>added a bad error catch in the vacuum step in v200->v201</li>
					<li>added some rollback exception handling for unusual situations</li>
					<li>the autocomplete caches under the client_cache subdirectory are dynamically folded into a single client.caches.db file, and that file is folded into the main db journal like the other attached dbs</li>
					<li>ac_cache file and tag processing lag and edge-case autocomplete miscounting should be removed as a result</li>

					<li>analyze mainenance now analyzes external databases</li>
					<li>the db connection now refreshes every half hour, to regularly clear out journal files</li>
					<li>the hydrus db assumes it generally has exclusive control over its db, so it no longer wraps its read-only requests in transactions</li>

					<li>the youtube video downloader now lists a webm option if youtube provides one (they seem to offer 360p webms on everything(?) now)</li>
					<li>the timedeltacontrol (where you set the period for the thread checker and import folders and so on) is replaced by the more compact timedeltabutton, which will launch a dialog with the old control when clicked</li>

					<li>misc cleanup of some server db stuff</li>
					<li>content update processing will not spam menu updates throughout, but only notify once at the end, which should reduce idle gui hang due to db access choke</li>
					<li>the autocomplete tag entry will not refresh system pred menu during idle, which should reduce idle gui hang due to db access choke</li>
					<li>shutdown repo sync will now report the update summary text and will not spam the intervening statuses to the log</li>
					<li>moved timestamp out of the serviceless media_result and into the locations_manager, to reflect the database's knowledge of each current service having a different timestamp</li>
					<li>local and trash timestamps are generated from the locations_manager now, and non-local file service timestamps will soon follow (e.g. 'pinned to ipfs_service 3 days ago')</li>
					<li>if the timestamp is unknown for the current service context, it will not be displayed</li>
					<li>file repositories will now only sync thumbnails when their updates are completely synced (to stop 404s from since-deleted files)</li>

				<ul>
					<li>exported hash and tag master tables to external database files for both client and server</li>

					<li>the manage tags censorship dialog now defaults to the 'all known tags' service on init</li>
					<li>slideshows will not progress if the current media is either a static image that has yet to render or an unpaused animation that has yet to run through once</li>
					<li>service content package status messages now summarise their final commit status better</li>
					<li>this nice new line is printed to the log as a record of repo sync rows/s speed</li>
					<li>the client will shut down faster if big jobs are running</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 200</h3></li>
				<ul>

					<li>because of the deleted_mappings extraction, a bunch of mappings membership tests are much simpler now</li>
					<li>upped the db cache size to a semi-ludicrous 150MB, which nonetheless seems to improve processing speed</li>
					<li>improved how hydrus databases manage their db file locations</li>

					<li>wrote a faster initialisation routine for all known files caches</li>
					<li>fixed an ac_cache cleanup typo</li>
					<li>the client's (usually gigantic) mappings table is temporarily extracted to an external db file, which should have numerous benefits and perhaps a few drawbacks for now</li>
					<li>the update will take a few more minutes, and will need lots of disk space, to extract the mappings</li>
					<li>the server has a very similar external mappings table, so it will also need a while to update, but future admin backup calls will be a lot quicker, due to a much smaller vacuum</li>

					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>on client boot, autocomplete caches for specific file/tag service cross-references are now initialised and populated. progress is shown on the splash window</li>
					<li>on client boot, surplus autocomplete caches are deleted</li>
					<li>on service add, new autocomplete caches are created</li>
					<li>on file add/delete, autocomplete caches are updated</li>
					<li>on mappings pend/add/rescind pend/delete, autocomplete caches are updated</li>
					<li>the new autocomplete caches are consulted for all non-'all known tags' queries</li>
					<li>the old autocomplete cache no longer stores counts for specific file services, and the remaining associated maintenance calls are deleted</li>
					<li>databases now start their own mainloops</li>
					<li>databases now wait for their mainloops to finish prepping any large caches before they return to the controller</li>
					<li>the client database waits for autocomplete caches to finish before it finishes its own mainloop</li>
					<li>the padding around flash and the animation bar are included more accurately in some media zoom calculations, which should eliminate some general zoom jankiness and accidental 100% flash zoom coincidences that filled up the whole canvas</li>
					<li>fixed some clientside server boot error spam when local server or booru had no port set</li>
					<li>account refreshes that fail due to a network error will spam less to the log</li>
					<li>fixed .txt unicode tag parsing from import folders, which was not decoding at the correct step</li>
					<li>administrator immediate repository syncs now sync thumbnail downloads if needed</li>
					<li>service thumbnail sync will no longer superfluously check the presence of thumbnails whose files are local</li>
					<li>if a tag entered into the manage tags dialog has a sibling that already exists for all files, then a new 'ignore, as the sibling already exists' choice will appear</li>
					<li>fixed an overcounting bug in 'selection tags' when importing and adding tags at the same time</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in repository sync status text that was overcounting total number of updates by one</li>
					<li>fixed youtube downloader, which broke with the new library on my new dev machine</li>
					<li>the way that tags and predicates are filtered against a tag autocomplete text entry is now much faster</li>
					<li>bumped up the default content update chunk threshold from 100 rows to 5,000, which seems to be speeding up processing significantly, with a cost to recovery latency--see how it works for you</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 196</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed the 8chan thread watcher for boards that host content on media.8ch.net</li>
					<li>improved the thread watcher url check logic so it won't lag with the new fix</li>
					<li>cleaned up the ac generation code a little</li>
					<li>'all known tags' ac counts are now summed from all the known tag services rather than calculated directly (a <= indicator for when these cases overlap will be forthcoming). this speeds up file add/delete, service reset, a/c fetch time, and general tag processing, and reduces the size of the db</li>
					<li>ac generation code now deals with 'is the entry text an exact match or not?' better</li>
					<li>ac generation code will now no longer produce non-exact-match siblings on an exact match search</li>
					<li>ac generation code will no longer save half complete search text into the db as new tags</li>

					<li>fixed the tumblr parser for the subtly new API</li>
					<li>import folders now support loading tags from neighbouring .txt files--check the dialog to set up which tag services you would like to import to</li>
					<li>the ipfs file downloader now queries DAG object links, determines if the given multihash is a directory or other complicated object, and if so politely dumps out (handling of directory downloads is forthcoming)</li>
					<li>some db code is cleaned up</li>
					<li>prepared db code for some future subclasses</li>
					<li>wrote most of the new ac cache db</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
					<li>added some browser addon links to the ipfs help</li>

				<ul>
					<li>wrote up a v1.0 ipfs help page</li>
					<li>added ipfs services to 'system:file service'</li>
					<li>added a 'multihash prefix' option to ipfs services in 'services->manage services'--it will prefix the given text to multihashes copied to the clipboard (e.g. you could use 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/')</li>
					<li>fixed a bad repo sync processing bug that was incorrectly assuming packages were completely processed when they often were not</li>
					<li>all repos will have their processing timestamps reset on update, forcing a (fast) reprocess of everything they have to cover the previously missed content</li>
					<li>fixed 8chan OP image parsing, which was sometimes failing due to absent md5s in the json</li>
					<li>widened the splash screen a little more so repo sync text can fit a bit better</li>
					<li>a couple of splash status texts are shuffled around</li>
					<li>updated to sqlite 3.11.0 for windows</li>
					<li>if sqlite3 reports at least version 3.11.0, the db will stick to WAL for large transactions (lke vacuum and content processing), since these are fast now</li>
					<li>'namespace:*anything*' will now only appear if the a/c input has no 'subtag' component., e.g. 'character:'</li>
					<li>import and export folders now print simple summaries to the log if they do some work</li>
					<li>tidied up the 'pages' menu</li>
					<li>the various hardcoded 'delete' key events are now also triggered by a backspace on os x</li>
					<li>added a rough 'copy known urls' to the regular thumbnail menu. this is prototype, let me know how you would like this information managed and displayed in future</li>
					<li>in prep for the new cache layer, the autocomplete dropdowns (and hence search domains of all contexts) no longer support 'all known files' cross referenced with 'all known tags'</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 194</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>ipfs pins and unpins can now be queued up like file repository pending and petitioned, through the regular thumbnail right-click menu, which also reports some/all ipfs pinned selection status</li>
					<li>this ipfs action queue is similarly summarised and commited at the normal service 'pending' menu</li>
					<li>ipfs's 'pinned', 'to pin', and 'to unpin' statuses are displayed on thumbnails with ipfs-specific icons</li>
					<li>you can copy the focussed file's ipfs multihash or all the selected files' ipfs multihashes from the thumbnail menu's share->copy->ipfs multihash</li>

					<li>the pending menu now specifies what it is about to do more plainly</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 193</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the client's local server and local booru can be turned off from their respective management panels, and from now on, the client will initialise with them this way.</li>
					<li>if the local server or the local booru are not running, their copy/share commands won't appear in right-click menus</li>
					<li>the welcome dialog is now a simpler popup message</li>
					<li>incidence sorted tag lists are now sub-sorted by a-z lexicographic</li>

					<li>idle mode now cannot naturally engage within the first two minutes since client boot</li>
					<li>the autocomplete search logic will not count namespace characters in the autocomplete character threshold, so typing 'character:a' will not typically trigger a (very laggy) full search</li>
					<li>putting a '*' anywhere in an autocomplete search_text will force a full search, ignoring the a/c character threshold</li>
					<li>moved some specific 'give gui time to catch up' pause code to the generalised pause/cancel code that a lot of stuff uses, so big jobs should generally be a bit more polite</li>
					<li>split the daemon class into two--one for big jobs that remains polite, and another for small jobs that triggers regardless of what else is going on. this should increase responsivity for a number of scenarios</li>
					<li>fixed some bad wal failure detection and hence no-wal file creation on some instances of db cursor reinit (usually after service modification). because of now many superfluous no-wal files, existing no-wal files will be deleted on db update</li>
					<li>some external storage location errors are improved</li>
					<li>some internal and external storage location init is improved.</li>
					<li>if an error is detected in the external storage location manager, it will not attempt to rebalance again until the client is rebooted</li>

					<li>cleaned up some misc shutdown thread-gui interaction error spam</li>
					<li>did some prep work on a future rewrite of daemon jobs pipeline</li>

					<li>added no-wal command line switch to disable WAL journalling for the db</li>
					<li>if the db fails to read a new WAL-journalled db file it has just created, it will delete the file and attempt to recreate the db, never trying WAL again</li>
					<li>changed the way the db writes big repo syncs to disk so that the job can be abandoned much more quickly</li>
					<li>improved local file not found error to state the directory or exact path that was the problem</li>
					<li>fixed some socket-level error reporting (I think timeout was part of this)</li>
					<li>the petition approval and denial client-to-server network commit is broken up into smaller steps to reduce server lag and the overall likelihood of timeouts</li>
					<li>subscriptions will no longer add files to their 'successful files' button when the file's url seemed new but it actually was previously deleted</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now identify themselves with an additional popup message when they encounter critical errors during sync</li>
					<li>editing a clientside service will force a reset of the appropriate session cache, so if you change access key, the account changes will be reflected immediately</li>
					<li>the import files dialog will no longer spam error popups on uninteresting or empty files--its 'parsing complete' statement is more verbose instead</li>
					<li>the 1.5s gap between parsing complete and the buttons being enabled is also removed. this was supposed to be helpful, to give you a moment to check the files were as expected, but in the end it was just annoying</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in some thumbnail error catching and regeneration</li>
					<li>improved my network code syncing, so linux and os x releases are cleared out of many old files</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 190</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed some hashing recalculation in collections that meant they reported no files in many cases</li>
					<li>fixed some hashing recalculation when 'remove files' is called</li>

					<li>the client now closes down more reliably if the gui fails to boot</li>
					<li>if a client vacuum fails, it'll now also raise the exact error sqlite gave</li>

					<li>misc code cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 189</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>split the big analyze db calls into individual table/index calls and moved them from update code to the normal maintenance routines</li>
					<li>on vacuum, both the client and server dbs will now bump their page size up to 4096 if they are running on windows (server vacuum is triggered by running a backup)</li>
					<li>vacuum should be a slightly faster operation for both the client and server</li>
					<li>boosted the db cache significantly--we'll see if it makes much difference for things.</li>
					<li>the way the selection tags control updates its taglist on increases to its media cache is massively sped up. An update on a 5,000-thumbnail-strong page now typically works in 3ms instead of ~250ms. large import pages should stream new results much more quickly now</li>
					<li>sped up some slow hash calculation code that was lagging a variety of large operations</li>
					<li>some hash caching responsibility is moved about to make it available for the add_media_results comparison, which now typically works in sub-millisecond time (was about 16ms before)</li>
					<li>some sorted media list index recalculation now works faster</li>
					<li>some internal media object hashing is now cached, so sorted list index regeneration is a bit faster</li>

					<li>http cannotsendrequest and badstatusline errors will now provoke two reattempts before being raised</li>
					<li>socket error 10013 (no access permission, usually due to a firewall) is caught and a nicer error produced</li>
					<li>socket error 10054 (remote host reset connection) is caught, and the connection is reattempted twice before being raised</li>
					<li>the old giphy API is gone, so I have removed giphy</li>
					<li>forced shutdown due to system exit/logoff is handled better</li>
					<li>pubsub-related shutdown exceptions are now caught and silenced</li>

					<li>improved db hash cross-reference flexibility</li>
					<li>any pausable popups will now explicitly change their text to 'paused' when they are paused</li>
					<li>upload pending popup now has a title, so it should pause a little more sanely</li>
					<li>regenerate thumbnails popup now has a title, so it should pause a little more sanely</li>
					<li>cleaned up some job pause status logic</li>
					<li>upload pending now works on a stream, so gigantic uploads will cause fewer hitches and overall problems</li>
					<li>upload pending code is cleaned and simplified in several ways, with better error handling and progress reporting</li>
					<li>synctotagarchive is now split into a thousand tiny separate jobs and runs on a separate non-db thread. it will no longer lock the db the whole time</li>
					<li>synctotagarchive popup should be a lot more responsive and will specifically give the gui some time to catch up after every chunk of data processed</li>
					<li>synctotagarchive will update pending tags count (and gui stuff will show the pending tags) as it goes</li>
					<li>synctotagarchive is now a pausable and cancellable operation!</li>
					<li>large repository sync jobs should be a little less laggy on final commit</li>
					<li>system:duration now displays its value as a properly formatted milliseconds time delta, rather than just a big int</li>
					<li>profiles now flush to the log immediately</li>
					<li>some cpu-heavy daemon recheck periods have been extended to reduce potential hangs on slower computers</li>
					<li>some repository sync messaging wording and logic is improved (it should report what it is doing more reliably when you are cpu-busy)</li>
					<li>reordered instances of 'waiting politely', so download text/gauge updates should occur before the wait does</li>
					<li>some misc 'waiting politely' logic is improved</li>

				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 187</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>file->restart now works for linux</li>

					<li>removed some console error junk on abandoned client boot</li>
					<li>if a requested full-size thumbnail is missing, the client will now attempt to regenerate it</li>

					<li>fixed a bug where under some circumstances, the gallery importer was attempting to display previously deleted files on the screen, causing errors.</li>

					<li>pixiv manga error handling is improved</li>
					<li>bad mime error handling is improved for all importers</li>
					<li>fixed an important bug in the import status cache where error texts were not being stored as unicode, so error texts with non-unicode-compatible characters were causing exceptions when the session was being saved to the db or the import status frame was being loaded</li>
					<li>existing sessions' import status caches should automatically convert their 'notes' to unicode on update</li>
					<li>removed booru db fetch spam when booru download page has no work to do</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in regenerate thumbnails popup message</li>
					<li>fixed some bad event handling for the gallery page's file limit control</li>

				</ul>

					<li>'fetch autocomplete results now' shortcut is now Ctrl+Space (Raw Control for OS X, not command)</li>
					<li>'IME mode toggle' is now Insert</li>
					<li>cleaned up how control is handled cross-platform--in general, 'control' is always control for windows and linux, and 'control' is command for os x. this may be incorrect.</li>

					<li>clipped sibling/parent reason entry dialog message when lots of pairs are added</li>

					<li>'predicate a' and its inverse '-predicate a' are no longer considered the same!</li>
					<li>namespace and wildcard predicates will now remove their inverts if they are added to the list of active predicates</li>
					<li>the way inverse predicates are generated and compared is generalised and improved</li>
					<li>fixed 'open a new search page for tag x', which might have been broken?</li>
					<li>quick-entering a tag in the 'read' tag autocomplete entry will now always replace with a sibling if one exists</li>
					<li>quick-entering a tag in the 'write' tag autocomplete entry will now not replace with a sibling--you will get the option of what you want to do</li>

					<li>also when this happens, the affected file count for add/pend the preferred sibling should now be correct</li>

					<li>added a checkbox to options->downloading to replace the traffic light waiting politely indicator with text</li>
					<li>subscriptions with failed files will say 'x urls in cache, y failed' on their dialog panel</li>
					<li>at the gui level, media that superfluously receives a 'pend tag' instruction for a tag that is already current will discard the instruction (this improves the accuracy of the pending tag count during and after the manage tag dialog)</li>
					<li>and the same thing for 'petition tag' when the tag isn't already current</li>
					<li>any accidentally added 'namespace:'-type tags will be deleted on update</li>

					<li>the 'run jobs on idle?' question is now explicit on the maintenance and processing panel</li>
					<li>deselecting 'run jobs on idle/shutdown' will now disable subordinate controls</li>
					<li>hitting tab on the autocomplete control now triggers an immediate 'fetch results' call</li>
					<li>added a checkbox to options->speed and memory to completely disable automatic autocomplete results fetching (i.e. if you want to manually control a/c result-fetching only with this new tab shortcut)</li>
					<li>the new less-laggy autocomplete results fetch won't trigger if the latest query is shorter than the cached query (i.e. you won't get lag when hitting backspace a bunch of times on autocomplete)</li>
					<li>hitting shift+tab on the autocomplete control now disables all other key event capture, letting you enter IME without your up/down/enter presses controlling the dropdown list of results</li>

					<li>fixed a couple of autocomplete tag-parsing bugs for tags with more than one colon character</li>
					<li>fixed some key event selection bugs in the autocomplete taglist when there are no results in the list</li>

					<li>unexpected serverside client disconnections are now caught and further request processing is cancelled</li>

					<li>Since display of large queries is so much faster, the ‘woah! 12,000 query results’ warning is gone.</li>
					<li>Fullscreen precache timings are rebalanced, hopefully for the better!</li>
					<li>The importing gui classes are a little smoother, and thumbs should load one by one, not row by row, once the page height is exceeded. The scrollbars should be less janky.</li>
					<li>Page transitions are smoother.</li>
					<li>Importing from URL will now load those urls that are already inside the db (hella fast, too), just like importing from hdd.</li>
					<li>The double-update-download bug is finally fixed! Now you’ll download update number 258 only once, and not twice in a row. (I hope!) It never mattered much, beyond a little CPU, but it annoyed the hell out of me. Working out what was wrong took ages. (Long story short: Python’s Priority Queues are not parallel FIFOs!)</li>
					<li>There was a weird bug in pending tags sometimes going to higher tag-precedence services, rather than the one chosen in the manage tags dialog.</li>
					<li>There was a typo in reset service.</li>
					<li>More content update unification in the db, making things much neater behind the scenes.</li>
					<li>I found a potential hang in the db-shutdown code.</li>
					<li>I found another potential hang in the db-shutdown code!</li>
					<li>The number of messages in your inbox is now displayed on the statusbar.</li>
					<li>Bold, Italic and Underline now work with Ctrl+B/I/U in the message compose panel.</li>
					<li>The ‘don’t receive messages from Anonymous’ checkbox in Add, Remove and Edit Services for message depots now does something.</li>
					<li>system:unread in message search now has a count.</li>
					<li>A draft will remember its saved changes when you click on another conversation and back again.</li>
					<li>You can now save a draft with zero recipients.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 41</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rich Text Control with Toolbar in messaging.</li>
					<li>Message unread/read status now syncs to message depot.</li>
					<li>Can set defaults for file system predicates.</li>
					<li>Animated Text class written.</li>
					<li>system:unread tag in messaging.</li>
					<li>Import bug fixed.</li>
					<li>Messaging search logic improved.</li>
					<li>Message depot default check time down to 180, and daemon thread improved to manage with that.</li>
					<li>Application startup is more stable.</li>
					<li>Some AddMessage logic improved.</li>
					<li>Drag+Drop service fixed and improved.</li>
					<li>Tags added while importing will now turn up in autocomplete.</li>
					<li>I unified more of the client’s content-update db calls. Just making stuff neater.</li>
					<li>I massively simplified the autocomplete tag code in preparation for another bash at doing autocomplete cache. A/C is far too slow atm, imo.</li>
					<li>Some A/C counts are still off, particularly when there are a mix of current and pending. I couldn’t figure out what is causing it, but I’ll look at it more as I do the cache.</li>
					<li>In add, remove and edit serivces, you can now specify if you want to receive messages from Anonymous or not. Unfortunately, because I forgot to implement it in DoMessageQuery, this checkbox doesn’t actually do anything yet! Whoops!</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 40</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Inbox/Archive for messaging works. The inbox icon is back, and F7 to archive as usual.</li>
					<li>Unread/Read for messaging works. Click on your status next to a message panel to change.</li>
					<li>All message participants are shown in the conversation listctrl.</li>
					<li>The message page will open with ‘system:inbox’ active, ordered by newest message.</li>
					<li>I fixed conversation listctrl sorting in a couple ways.</li>
					<li>Some bugs in the db->gui update reporting system are fixed, so the compose window and draft panel will close properly on a message-send, and the conversation listctrl will swiftly update unread counts and inbox status and so on.</li>
					<li>The draft panel’s save button wasn’t updating sometimes when it should have been.</li>
					<li>html links in messages will show in the main frame’s statusbar and launch in your browser when clicked.</li>
					<li>I reworked how many system tags are searched in file queries to make them muuuuch faster. Now, any time you go system:hash, :size, :mime, :age, :width, :height, :duration, it (should) be significantly faster than before.</li>
					<li>Ever have a png file that had an ok thumbnail but a black preview/fullscreen? It was probably an ‘LA’ image, or ‘greyscale with an alpha channel’. Display of LA images is now fixed.</li>
					<li>Streamlined the way file ‘archive’ and ‘delete’ commands are sent throughout the application, with an eye to eventually adding all other user-commands to the same system (to make it simpler, and also to do undo-redo).</li>
					<li>I’ve updated the help docs, including the section on how messaging actually works.</li>
					<li>You can now enter system tags with enter/return from the keyboard, not just double-clicking with the mouse.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 39</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>A whole bunch of stuff I didn’t write down that generally made messages work beyond sending “Hello World”.</li>
					<li>Unicode messages now work.</li>
					<li>Newlines in messages now display properly.</li>
					<li>Fixed contact saving and drag-and-drop to the manage contacts dialog.</li>
					<li>You can now add a contact using a contact address (assuming their service is v39).</li>
					<li>A bug in contact renaming is fixed.</li>
					<li>My contact (hydrus admin) is now added automatically.</li>
					<li>Messages are orphan-deleted properly server-side.</li>
					<li>Message depots you control now get an entry under the admin menu.</li>
					<li>The conversation listctrl is now properly sorted.</li>
					<li>The HtmlWindow that shows message body is now resized to its minimum needed height via magic that I ain’t gotta explain.</li>
					<li>Messages that fail to send can be retried by clicking on the failed.</li>
					<li>Some draft save/send button enable/disable logic was updated.</li>
					<li>I switched around some server-side account logic.</li>
					<li>You can’t zoom a flash window bigger than the screen.</li>
					<li>I’ve made the mouse appear in fullscreen when you move it, and this includes while you drag. See how you feel about it. I’ll make options to change behaviour if people care.</li>
					<li>Better zip structure. (No more CWD rubbish)</li>
					<li>New tar.gz release with only the code and help. Code is 1.2MB, help is 14MB lol. I’ll improve the structure of this release next week. I threw it together by hand today, but I’ll improve its structure next week.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 38</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>messaging v1.0</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 37</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>messaging prototype</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 36</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>animated gif fixes</li>
					<li>new page chooser</li>
					<li>svcp->cstvcp in fullscreen too</li>
					<li>new import progress</li>
					<li>just start the server on this computer, please</li>
					<li>I think I have scrolling to the current selection after an archive fixed now.</li>
					<li>Started an experimental simpler way to send commands to the db, which may open the way for undo-redo.</li>
					<li>Capitalisation option in file->options->gui. It only does the menubar for now, but I will expand it.</li>
					<li>Custom sorts/collects. Under file->options. Check it out, play with it if you care about it.</li>
					<li>Some program initialisation error handling is cleaned up.</li>
					<li>Can now no longer start a server if the admin port it wants to use is occupied. (can’t run two servers at once on the same port)</li>
					<li>I broke dump with a typo in a previous release, I think! It is fixed now.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 35</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Slight speedup of review services frame loadtime.</li>
					<li>SVCP now replaced with SCTVCP and CSTVCP for now, with more planned next week.</li>
					<li>Repo sync daemon adds db jobs less manically, now, locking up the gui less.</li>
					<li>Repo sync daemon reports successful updates to the log.</li>
					<li>Tag petition review page has a visual bug fixed.</li>
					<li>ThumbnailMediaPanel manages its underlying bmp canvas more intelligently.</li>
					<li>Some ugly page-closing code was cleaned up.</li>
					<li>There is a ‘regex examples’ popout window on the regex-filename-tag import dialog, with copy-pastable examples of python regexes that’ll work for common filename-parsing situations.</li>
					<li>Home and End keys now select the first/last thumbnail as well as scrolling.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 34</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>DB consolidation, and foreign keys and triggers with it. The db is less prone to orphan ids and miscounts.</li>
					<li>For long-time users, all orphan ids should have all been deleted, reducing weirdness.</li>
					<li>Total size of local service is now tracked accurately.</li>
					<li>Archive while importing should work a bit better now.</li>
					<li>Update logic should be more reliable, as should all service_updates.</li>
					<li>Archive count for file repos should be less wrong.</li>
					<li>Fixed two (!) typos in system:age predicate code.</li>
					<li>File upload is fixed (not sure if it was ever broken in release, but I fixed the stupid thing I did anyway)</li>
					<li>DB (and server) errors should report better now, revealing inner-db code in the traceback. (and printing it to the appropriate log)</li>
					<li>Improved the mime_to_enum object for image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/jpe, image/wtfaretheygoingtocalljpegnow.</li>
					<li>HTTP connections can deal with some esoteric commands, like 301, without throwing a fit. All http goes through the same code.</li>
					<li>Danbooru should now be in your booru list, and it _should_ work.</li>
					<li>Pausing/Cancelling a booru gallery parse should now work.</li>
					<li>4chan dumper now understands captchas being wrong and the thread not existing; in the former case it’ll let you put in a new captcha and try again, in the latter it’ll stop the whole dump.</li>
					<li>Some general code neatness improvements.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 33</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Boorus are working for users who started last week</li>
					<li>The server can now manage many more simultaneous requests without bugging out.</li>
					<li>The early freeze/import freeze due to simultaneous access in the client is fixed.</li>
					<li>The client’s file+thumbnail server (details in help’s advanced.html) works again.</li>
					<li>Client DB now stores md5 and sha1 for all local files.</li>
					<li>Client DB has a larger cache size.</li>
					<li>The freeze caused when importing thousands of files at once with tags is fixed.</li>
					<li>The yaml imageboard import (when you drag and drop a .yaml file onto the imageboards dialog) now adds form fields correctly! If you had problems here, check out install_path/static/default_imageboards.yaml to reset them!</li>
					<li>The autocomplete counts should be more accurate, particularly when there are a mix of current and pending tags in the db.</li>
					<li>The autocomplete in the regex-path dialog will now search the db correctly (it was misconfigured).</li>
					<li>Autocomplete is also just a _little_ faster</li>
					<li>File imports are now low priority, so gui activity should still happen nice and quick even while an import is occurring.</li>
					<li>The review services frame will now show how long until the next update will be checked (see picture above). In case of error, it will show how long until it tries again.</li>
					<li>The review services panel and manage services panel are of a better default size, and they use my new listbook class exclusively, rather than the old notebook.</li>
					<li>I’ve added some tooltips on not-obvious widgets.</li>
					<li>Content Updates have vastly improved processing speed on a thumbnail view (x100 in some cases!). Tag updates particularly will not be so slow to process if you have a large search open.</li>
					<li>The import gauge will now show the correct range according to the current queue size, not always the default 100.</li>
					<li>Active Import Pages will throw up a yes/no dialog if you try to close them.</li>
					<li>Some beautifying of code syntax. ‘\n’ is now os.linesep, which means exported stuff should show up better in notepad.</li>
					<li>Some changes in network protocol, although now I think of them, I realise I forgot to update the network version. They aren’t important for most users, so w/e.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 32</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>client db serialisation DONE</li>
					<li>Cleaned up a dirty-bmp canvas init issue.</li>
					<li>Resized some dlg stuff that was too tall</li>
					<li>Cleaned up a bunch of unrelated db code</li>
					<li>Tightened the pubsub system so it integrates better with wx.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 31</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>booru prototype</li>
					<li>Fixed some problem with last error timestamp </li>
					<li>Fixed a bug in repo bandwidth tracking</li>
					<li>Fixed URL registration with the client db.</li>
					<li>Made downloading URLs asynchronous again</li>
					<li>Made repo synchronisations not block so much, and not for nearly as long. You should be able to do queries and click on thumbs (albeit at a slower rate) while the client is downloading and processing updates.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 30</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Thumbs are exported, and, along with perceptual hashes, now treated as a global pool, reducing downloads and speeding queries.</li>
					<li>Thumbnail resize is now asynchronous, done as each thumbnail is requested. Changing the thumbnail size in the options dialog happens real quick, and if you don’t like a particular size, you can change it back just as fast.</li>
					<li>Temporary DB locking mechanisms ensure serialisation, less inefficient locking.</li>
					<li>ImportPage superclass works a lot better, in a lot less code. DB import code is now even simpler, and much faster, especially for redundant files. The new import page will also tell you how many files were successful/failed/already deleted/already in the db.</li>
					<li>Fetching images for fullscreen or preview is fully asynchronous, and will no longer block the gui thread.</li>
					<li>Some query logic is improved.</li>
					<li>You can now import and export sites/imageboards from the manage imageboards dialog. It’ll export to a .yaml file, which is easy to understand with a decent text editor. Just drag and drop onto the dialog to import.</li>
					<li>Selecting thumbs has a little less preview-flicker now.</li>
					<li>The new tagboxes now render numbers prettily, so 4123 -> 4,123.</li>
					<li>(+) namespace:tag now colours properly.</li>
					<li>The background for selected tags is now an appropriate colour.</li>
					<li>You can now choose the colours of any namespace you like in the normal options dialog.</li>
					<li>Clicking in whitespace in the new tagbox deselects, rather than select( 0 )s.</li>
					<li>Spacebar, PageDown, Return and all the other special command characters are now propagated to flash in fullscreen view, just as long as the mouse is over the canvas.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 29</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Big changes to the db’s file storage, as above.</li>
					<li>database->vacuum is reinstated, database->reindex is retired. I recommend you run a vacuum once you are updated; it’ll only take a minute now.</li>
					<li>Rollback and initialisation bugs are fixed.</li>
					<li>There’s a splash window now that can offer client-boot feedback.</li>
					<li>The way scrolling-to-focus is calculated is improved.</li>
					<li>Pretty much everywhere you see tags will now show coloured tags! I finished up my own tagbox class, which for now will show tags coloured in the default booru scheme. It also loads in a few milliseconds, rather than the ~0.5s of the default listbox. It scrolls faster, too. I’ll have user-customisable colours next release.</li>
					<li>Files with invalid resolution, size and mime are now filtered out before dumping to an imageboard.</li>
					<li>A number of misc other bugs were fixed.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 28</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>I fixed the ‘searching immediately’ bug. It was a stupid typo as usual.</li>
					<li>Post-Filter scrolling should be a bit more reliable.</li>
					<li>Some more log events.</li>
					<li>I did a lot of work on my new tags box, although the actualy gui elements will have to be finished for v29.</li>
					<li>Manage Imageboards wasn’t saving properly. It is now.</li>
					<li>My new progressdialog happens in several places. It is a little neater than the one in wx; just better for my purposes.</li>
					<li>I reworked some of the transaction stuff in the db so that I can atomically queue pubsub events. (this means file import are less juddery)</li>
					<li>After becoming very annoyed with wx’s listbook/labelbook/whateverbook, I wrote my own. It’s all over the place in my dialogs now. It is tighter, more reliable, and can scroll.</li>
					<li>I reworked some of the way sets interacted.</li>
					<li>There was an infinite recursion bug sometimes, when uploading files to a file repo.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 27</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Cleared out some old unused library imports, so the client is slightly smaller.</li>
					<li>Had a cyclical import (!). Luckily, python is forgiving, but I have still fixed it.</li>
					<li>Collection thumbnails will now update with their new pending tags correctly.</li>
					<li>Some wx.Panel vs wx.Window issues and nomenclature resolved.</li>
					<li>Full Page decouple. Now the window to the left is a seperate, much neater class. It and the media/preview windows talk to each other in a clever way that means I can make new kinds of page much faster. It scrolls, too.</li>
					<li>Thumbnails resize will tell the thumbnail window just to redraw itself, not refresh the entire query.</li>
					<li>‘system:local’ and ‘system:not local’ are now mutually exclusive (will swap each other out, rather than overlap), like inbox and archive.</li>
					<li>A little neatening of the system predicate code.</li>
					<li>‘system:similar_to’ RMB menu entry fixed for some cases.</li>
					<li>There is a new log window. Go view->new log page to see it. It doesn’t show much right now, but you can see synchro successes and errors pop up as they happen.</li>
					<li>There is now a popup button on the import dialog and the URL downloader page that does ‘advanced import options’. You can now tell these import processes to archive everything and/or ignore files below a certain size or resolution. By default, the client will not import anything <5KB or <50x50px. You can set no limit.</li>
					<li>Flash windows will now own all keystrokes as long as the mouse cursor is over the flash. If you are browsing/filtering, just move your mouse over or off the flash window to make sure your return/page down/spacebar/escape/whatever is interpreted as you want.</li>
					<li>The URL downloader will not download the same file twice in a row, so you can add a thread URL several times in a row, and it’ll only download the newest files. The behaviour of this is affected by the ‘exclude deleted files’ checkbox in the client’s options. I’ll implement thread watching a bit later.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 26</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The double unnamespaced count bug ( ‘system:blah (70)’, ‘blah (140)’ ) in autocomplete should be gone.</li>
					<li>Some rejiggering of how the statusbar updates means active import windows can’t spam the statusbar when they don’t have focus.</li>
					<li>The count of pending tags is more accurate and uniform. When it says (+3), it means for three files, not in three cases.</li>
					<li>Tag counts overall are better. When it says ‘diaper vore (17)’, you should be getting 17 files if you enter that search.</li>
					<li>GUI tag repo precedence is slightly more accurate, compared to what the db thinks it should be.</li>
					<li>I nailed down why system:mime wasn’t working sometimes, and now it should work all the time.</li>
					<li>I discovered some problems with repo-side bandwidth tracking. I fixed a couple bits, but have notes to look at it more.</li>
					<li>In v25, if system:limit was greater than the search population, it threw an error! Whoops! Fixed now.</li>
					<li>The post-filtering thumbnail problem is totally fixed, as are a couple other instances when thumbs would sometimes not draw.</li>
					<li>The fullscreen change-image-jittering-around problem is fixed, I think.</li>
					<li>Fullscreen archive works again. Not sure why/when it broke.</li>
					<li>Importing with archive checkbox ticked sometimes didn’t archive, lol.</li>
					<li>A bunch of decoupling of gui elements, making for much neater code and less gui blocking.</li>
					<li>Decoupling of import from hdd as well.</li>
					<li>Query is now asynchronous! If you do a massive query on a slow computer, you won’t lose the gui! You can go check other tabs, whatever, and the query will process in the background, rendering on the page you started it when it is done.</li>
					<li>A number of cpu-heavy numbers are now cleverly cached, so system predicate fetch happens much faster, especially on 100,000+ image dbs.</li>
					<li>Some ‘collect’ code is sped up and made generally less bonkers.</li>
					<li>I wrote a couple new classes for my most common gui elements.</li>
					<li>There is now an option in file->options to change the number of characters before autocomplete will go search the db for tags! If you have a slow computer and a huge db, you can set it to 2, 3 or even more chars. Default is 1.</li>
					<li>Dialogs that ask you questions will now usually center on their parent window.</li>
					<li>The current selection tagsbox won’t show ( ‘blah (12)’, ‘blah (+3)’ ), it’ll combine into ‘blah (12) (+3) (-1)’. With the + meaning pending and the - meaning petitioned.</li>
					<li>Autocomplete now respects which of the include_current and include_pending buttons are green! It’ll only search current/pending as you wish! And the numbers will now be accurate!</li>
					<li>My new question dialog with the yes/no buttons hooks the Escape key to mean no.</li>
					<li>I don’t use it much yet, but I have a new message dialog too.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 25</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Thumbnails should load just a bit quicker.</li>
					<li>Made some dict + set code neater</li>
					<li>A new end-of-filtering dialog makes the choices a bit more obvious</li>
					<li>When you exit from fullscreen/filter view, the main thumbnail view it was based on should select (and scroll to!) where you were. But filtering is less reliable, since you may have just deleted the last thing you were looking at!</li>
					<li>Better scrolling in thumbnail view</li>
					<li>Scrolling in thumbnail view will follow the current selection, so the focussed media will always be visible.</li>
					<li>Double right-clicking in filter now deletes instead of keeps (typo)</li>
					<li>Slightly less flickering when processing repo updates</li>
					<li>Made some form code neater</li>
					<li>A lot of the thumbnail gui code has been decoupled and pubsub’d. It is all neater behind the scenes, meaning I’ll be able to extend it easier in future.</li>
					<li>I completely overhauled how my pubsub works. (pubsub is a messaging system inside the code). It is more flexible and easier for me to work with.</li>
					<li>system:mime was not working in v23, not sure why. It’s fixed now.</li>
					<li>Some small speedup + neatening in db queries.</li>
					<li>You can now scroll to the end of a thumbnail page by pressing End. WARNING: If you have like 10,000 thumbs in the current pane, it is going to have to load all those.</li>
					<li>In the AutocompleteTagWrite object, which is the tag entry box in the manage tags dialog, there was a stupid bug that made many requests more expensive. It’s fixed.</li>
					<li>Autocomplete now works off one character’s input.</li>
					<li>I’ve swapped a bunch of expensive objects with easier staticbitmaps for now</li>
					<li>some A/C ordering changes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 24</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>imageboard dumper prototype</li>
					<li>some db update stuff</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 23</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>A typo was disallowing petition rescinds in certain cases.</li>
					<li>I’ve rearranged some of the RMB menu separators to reduce filter/archive misclicks.</li>
					<li>Tag pending upload has more accurate GUI response.</li>
					<li>You can now find similar images from RMB menu.</li>
					<li>Petition approvals are mirrored on an admin’s client.</li>
					<li>The gui now accepts that admins can overrule deleted content.</li>
					<li>Couple tiny URL downloader gui bugs fixed</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 22</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>system:similar_to</li>
					<li>Some backend namespace stuff</li>
					<li>Couple of gui presentation fixes</li>
					<li>I removed the clunky inbox and archive buttons, see how you feel about it.</li>
					<li>I tried to do ultimatelistctrl to have coloured tags (like a *booru), but it was too buggy and slow for the client’s purposes, so I’ll probably have to write my own control.</li>
					<li>system:mime exists, now. Not many mimes, yet, but have a play with it, see if you like it.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 21</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>On opening the URL downloader, the textbox input focuses.</li>
					<li>The URL downloader has some better update texts. It pauses nicely, etc…</li>
					<li>The URL downloader now orders urls in the order they are parsed. I forgot I was throwing the links in a set, losing all order!</li>
					<li>You won’t see dupes in the URL downloaders’ mediaresultswindow.</li>
					<li>Accounts should now correctly refresh on version update.</li>
					<li>When accounts fail to sync, it dumps the error in the log.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 20</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The preview pane should be a little less schizophrenic.</li>
					<li>Some code cleaning up behind the scenes.</li>
					<li>Thumbnail download optimisation if they already exist locally.</li>
					<li>Icons will show/hide in fullscreen with mouse movement, just like 21/123.</li>
					<li>Weird archiving bug on import is fixed. It was display only.</li>
					<li>Manage tags dialog now works in fullscreen, lol.</li>
					<li>system:not_uploaded_to: now works</li>
					<li>services->review services now loads muuuuuch faster (after the first time)</li>
					<li>There was a typo in setting up initial server’s accounts. Email me if you can’t make new admins.</li>
					<li>Importing is more streamlined, with more shared code.</li>
					<li>Importing with tags dialog happens more naturally in the import process. You can now do it from drag and drop imports!</li>
					<li>I reordered the default collection dropdown. Your default may be changed, so check your options.</li>
					<li>You can now fetch an account by a deleted file (hash).</li>
					<li>Thumbnails’ tags now obey tag precedence for deleted stuff. I hope.</li>
					<li>Modify Account Dialog now does its stuff.</li>
					<li>Collections thumbnails now show how many files are in the collection, just next to the icon.</li>
					<li>I’ve added to and edited the help extensively, replacing screenshots and updating the text.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 19</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>drop librarium nomenclature</li>
					<li>More intelligent prefetch in fullscreen - things should load muuuuuch faster</li>
					<li>A little more intelligent sum() calcs in autocomplete - non-namespaced tags now sum all their namespaced versions as well</li>
					<li>More rigorous client db transactions, just to make things more pretty and reliable.</li>
					<li>Moved db files to /db, logs to /logs</li>
					<li>Made inroads to getting review services to load faster, but version 20 will have more here.</li>
					<li>I’ve updated the frame view so the file info is draw on top of the image. It’s a hack for now, inside the image-frame, but it is the only solution for wx’s annoying ‘no overlapping’ policy.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 18</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Some misc gui image info bugs fixed</li>
					<li>Review services dialog is less pubsub buggy</li>
					<li>Fullscreen image prefetch does more and hopefully more intelligently</li>
					<li>Entering a blank tag to quit tag dialog was broke when I updated autocomplete textctrls. I’ve fixed it.</li>
					<li>Petition page is fixed, so I can finally clear out the tag petitions!</li>
					<li>F10 was broke when the lib had deleted files lol! Fixed it.</li>
					<li>Review services is more responsive to repo permissions updates.</li>
					<li>Flash files are now correctly put in the inbox on import.</li>
					<li>Synchronise Repositories daemon no longer takes ten gui-blocking seconds to process every update! This was an annoying slowdown, but I figured out what it was and reduced it to <1s with a quick patch. The problem will return with private tag repos, but I’ll deal with that when I come to it.</li>
					<li>Synchronise Accounts daemon has some better pubsub so it fires more intelligently. This in turn affects several other daemons, which should all be more responsive; e.g. when your permissions change, your pending thumbs/files should start downloading.</li>
					<li>Improved delete orphans logic for the fiftieth time! It is great now, and won’t ever bug you in the gui; it runs invisibly on shutdown and usually only takes a few secs to do its job.</li>
					<li>Some of the gui updates triggered by the daemons are optimised so they block the gui less. Multiple stuff is bundled into single updates, those updates are less buggy, and the gui catches them better. Resetting the public tag repo will no longer lock up a slow system.</li>
					<li>A few versions ago I changed the way repos were registered with the gui, and I’ve fixed some of the resultant daemon-related errors. This mostly affects admins, which mostly means me!</li>
					<li>Download Thumbnails daemon was getting pretty slow for large dbs (100k+ files) because of an inefficient db query. This has been cleared up.</li>
					<li>I banged my head against the wall for a couple of hours getting nested notebooks to work, and I am now a better person for it. Review and Manage Services dialogs feature better panel management as a result. Their panels are also much richer, reporting loads more data about the respective service. You can now see how many mappings the public tag repo has without having to delve into sqlite db browser.</li>
					<li>I have unified panel and frame background colouring away from wx’s bonkers idea of what things should be coloured. It should mean that everything is properly grey, but please tell me if your gui turns all black or transparent or whatever.</li>
					<li>21457 is now 21,457 in pretty much all cases where it is appropriate.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug with wx gauges not liking large ranges because of signed short or whatever underlying var the C code was using to store it. (That should have been done at the wx-python level, but whatever.)</li>
					<li>‘localhost’ resolves to 127.0.0.1 when editing a service, mainly because windows freaks out at the former, deciding to take a couple seconds longer to make any raw connection.</li>
					<li>Dialogs and frames have better, multi-monitor-friendly positioning.</li>
					<li>Flash files are loaded from a temp folder beneath the install dir, rather than lib’s server, for various reasons. This temp dir also manages file copy/paste operations. I may move this back to the OS’s approved temp folder, but we’ll see.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 17</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Tag negation “-tag” works again</li>
					<li>You can now cancel a filter on the first image</li>
					<li>Some weird filenames that were breaking the new import page no longer do</li>
					<li>Autocomplete (either when searching for tags or adding new ones in) will now show the number of files tagged with that tag after the tag e.g. here</li>
					<li>Manage tag dialog now pops up slightly to the upper left, rather than the center (default) of the screen, so you can see what you are tagging. I may make this more intelligent in future, so it remembers where you last left it.</li>
					<li>I changed a couple small things in help regarding the new import.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 16</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Numtags system predicate now takes into account which of current/pending tags buttons you have active.</li>
					<li>Thumbnail downloads fire more reliably.</li>
					<li>Downloading a file was causing funky thumbnail draw, which seems to be fixed.</li>
					<li>Delete Orphans daemon only fires on application close now, so post-filter db lag is gone.</li>
					<li>Daemons now use events, not conditions! lololol, I’m an idiot who can’t scroll down a library doc. For the longest time I was like “I wish ‘threading’ had events!” and it does.</li>
					<li>Some account checks were missing in tag upload, but are now there.</li>
					<li>A gigantic db rewrite that altered pretty much every table and query.</li>
					<li>Calculation of tags for current selection now support collections, and is fast.</li>
					<li>Was deleting a repo broke in 15? If it was, sorry! Didn’t catch it, but it’s fixed with the new system now.</li>
					<li>Pubsub can do more, and is a little less ‘argh, I think it works like that’, and more OOP</li>
					<li>The way tags are held by a thumb can support multiple tag servers (but only does public tag repo for now)</li>
					<li>Repos are now a subclass of ‘service’. I’ll do more on this in the next version, including some nomenclature changes in the gui.</li>
					<li>Imports are now asynchronous! There’s a new import page that’ll open on any import. It’s a little jittery, but it all works. If you import 3000 tiny files, your gui may lock up for a few secs since it’ll be able to import faster than it updates the gui.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 15</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>manage tags dialog focus bug hotfix</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 14</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Selection’s tags box now shows collections’ singletons’ tags</li>
					<li>Autocomplete now sources from the current thumbnails whenever it can (faster than db), and does so intelligently</li>
					<li>Couple of small display bugs fixed</li>
					<li>Some delete logic approved</li>
					<li>Repos do some more efficient inserts on POST content</li>
					<li>Petition optimisation, for auto-soft-approval before update gen</li>
					<li>Dialog parents, dialog parents everywhere</li>
					<li>DB cleanup of a couple of old methods</li>
					<li>Autocomplete Write (when adding tags in manage tags dialog) now sources from the entire network’s tags (not just for the files on your hard drive) when you type enough letters to stump it. i.e. If you have no files tagged ‘evangelion’, but you do have a file tagged ‘eve’, it’ll show ‘eve’ if you type ‘ev’, but if you type ‘eva’, it’ll requery the db more widely, and give you ‘evangelion’.</li>
					<li>system:ratio for searching for wallpapers or whatever. Combine with system:width>x for extra utility!</li>
					<li>You can now hit F3 (manage tags) in fullscreen, whether browsing or filtering.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 13</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>a couple of cpu-intensive DAEMONS schedule themselves better. (less slowdown after a big filter)</li>
					<li>image rendering prefetch improved</li>
					<li>smoother image rendering to screen (especially when zooming), less flickering</li>
					<li>petition approval has smoother, less buggy workflow</li>
					<li>new hashes and tags are added to the db muuuuuuuuch more efficiently. most public tag repo updates happen in a second or two, rather than 30+</li>
					<li>some of the internal commands are streamlined together into a single class</li>
					<li>ctrl-s fixed</li>
					<li>clear pending file repos pubsub fixed</li>
					<li>ctrl-r now shows/hides splitters</li>
					<li>thumbnail delete logic is better</li>
					<li>select logic is better</li>
					<li>deleted_remote_files bug fixed</li>
					<li>headache-inducing weakref repositories __eq__ bug in pubsub fixed</li>
					<li>‘with’ keyword all over the place now. turns out wx has a bunch of objects with support it (including dialogs!)</li>
					<li>gridsizers are now all flexgridsizers</li>
					<li>the list of tags on the current selection now has a weight attached like ‘flower (23)’ to show how many of the current selection have that tag. it doesn’t support collections’ weight yet.</li>
					<li>revised some ambiguous repo error messages</li>
					<li>you can now have a main window with no pages open</li>
					<li>right click menus on a selection are vastly improved (lots more info), but still a way to go.</li>
					<li>on the import files dialog, you can now specify to auto-archive rather than send to inbox</li>
					<li>thumbnails now know where they are uploaded/pending/petitioned to and will show that info with different icons</li>
					<li>escape key now deselects</li>
					<li>manage repos dialog is completely revised. comments appreciated.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 12</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>You can now tell lib to search ‘current tags’ only, ‘pending tags’ only, or both.</li>
					<li>Tag search is more efficient.</li>
					<li>Search in general is more efficient.</li>
					<li>Search code is more beautiful and decoupled.</li>
					<li>Tags are stored in memory more beautifully, and a similar class holds repositories for thumbs also.</li>
					<li>Age predicate is fixed (twice!)</li>
					<li>Server code is more beautiful. DB-Server interface is decoupled into a mixin class to make it easier to understand and manage.</li>
					<li>Icons for pending and petitioned files, and for ‘currently downloading’.</li>
					<li>Prefetch fixed, so nearby fullscreen images load just in case you want to see them.</li>
					<li>Fixed a redundant pending tags bug</li>
					<li>Fixed a swf tag petitions bug</li>
					<li>On boot, temp folder is cleared.</li>
					<li>The ‘current tags’ window is now union on the current selection, not intersect. If nothing is selected, it shows all the tags of the current selection. In a later version, I’ll order this list by count-weight.</li>
					<li>All (I think) tag updates are synchronous-ish with the gui. As updates come in from the public repo, thumbs will update themselves appropriately. Same goes for repositories.</li>
					<li>Gui-code tidy-up</li>
					<li>On deleting a local file, preview clears.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 11</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>swf support, lol</li>
					<li>You can now backup repositories from the admin menu. Info in help.</li>
					<li>Under the help menu, a quick way to set up the beta repositories’ credentials.</li>
					<li>Account sync was full of bugs, and is now less so.</li>
					<li>When you go fullscreen, the preview window should go blank, which should save a little cpu time when you are looking at gifs and your ears when you are looking at swfs.</li>
					<li>Auto-complete is muuuuuch faster than it was. Also more correct. Still more work to do, though.</li>
					<li>Librarium hosts an http server on 45874, which supports GET /file and /thumbnail just like a file repo. Utterly prototype, but you can test it right in your browser if you like. Go http://127.0.0.1:45874/file?hash=whatever when lib is running.</li>
					<li>Ctrl-T opens a new local page/tab, Ctrl-W closes the currently active</li>
					<li>Image display in preview and fullscreen has been revamped, and is now both a little buggy and much better.</li>
					<li>Bandwidth tracking both server- and client-side should be more reliable.</li>
					<li>Delete lag (the slowdown after you boot/delete something) should be reduced.</li>
					<li>Query lag is significantly reduced, and new operators for predicates have been added. You can now go ˜ on a bunch of values like size and width and duration to get ‘approximately equal to’, which actually means plus or minus about five percent.</li>
					<li>A stupid error on file upload is fixed. If you’ve been having problems seeing the files you uploaded in preview, try resetting the respective file repository.</li>
					<li>A few daemon bug fixes.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 10</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>hotfix for tag updates</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 9</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Pressing a cursor key when no thumb is focussed no longer throws an exception.</li>
					<li>Hitting enter on a blank input in the manage tags dialog now quickly oks the dialog.</li>
					<li>Annoying splitter exception on import is gone. It was a one-line fix, because I was being stupid.</li>
					<li>All searches should be a little faster. Mostly effects searches with 1000+ results.</li>
					<li>Modal dialogs (in particular) should be just a little more responsive now. Less stuff is being dumped on the wx gui thread, and all db handling is more parallel.</li>
					<li>Slow petition approval fixed, made almost instant.</li>
					<li>Image rendering has been revamped. It should be less stuttery now, but there is still more work to do.</li>
					<li>Some pending tag update logic was fixed.</li>
					<li>If the focused thumb goes from ‘not local’ to ‘local’, its preview will load. (its on my to-do to do the opposite: clearing preview on delete in remote search.</li>
					<li>DB daemons rewritten completely, so now a whole bunch of stuff flushes more efficiently, more reliably, and with less gui-blocking. Things happen smoother now.</li>
					<li>Can now create repository database backups via librarium. Sending the command (via the admin menu) tells the repo to lock and copy its .db files to .db.backup. I’ll update help to explain this more.</li>
					<li>Can now copy files from within librarium to the clipboard! Just select from the right-click menu or press Ctrl-C, and your selection will be copied to clipboard. You can then paste to any directory, for quick export to anywhere. The export command remains for exporting thousands of files.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 8</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed a missing transaction on repo db update.</li>
					<li>Export path can now be on other hard drives. You’ll probably want to keep it on the same drive if you have lib on a usb stick, though.</li>
					<li>Fixed a really stupid ‘&lt;’ for ‘&gt;’ typo that was causing a ton of gui blocking and repository slowdown.</li>
					<li>File and thumbnail downloads are much snappier.</li>
					<li>One person had a very odd error while trying to open manage repos. I don’t understand what actually caused the traceback to happen, but I think I fixed it nonetheless.</li>
					<li>inbox/archive buttons above the searchbox are now mutually exclusive.</li>
					<li>Fixed the version number in lib’s about window.</li>
					<li>Fixed the preview window so it remembers its last size properly. Also reduced its min size so you can make it tiny.</li>
					<li>Fixed the problem people were having with admin rights. See this post if you were having problems.</li>
					<li>The RegisterRepoRequest that was filling people’s logs on upload should be fixed now. Turns out I didn’t understand how wx.CallAfter works during modal dialogs! I threw in a horrible fix, but it works. I’ll revisit it.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 7</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>db changes are done</li>
					<li>fixed a bug with posting tag petitions</li>
					<li>when typing tags in, autocomplete now harvests from pending tags as well as current</li>
					<li>the regex dialog’s tag entry is now autocomplete</li>
					<li>leading/following whitespace removal for tags, and multi-whitespace -> single</li>
					<li>a little server-side pubsub neatening up</li>
					<li>when importing via dialog, there is now a checkbox to ignore subdirectories</li>
					<li>Added a quick readme.txt in the base_dir for people who choose to extract rather than install. (Everyone should check out the help at least once)</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 3->6 (never released)</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>after much feedback, completely rewrite db</li>
					<li>general improvements to gui</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 2</h3></li>

				<ul>
					<li>move to python and wx, and an application- rather than browser-based model</li>
					<li>building on concepts</li>
					<li>scrapping p2p, turning to client-server</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>early versions of beta</h3></li>
