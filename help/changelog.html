			<h3>changelog</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>version 360</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>tag autocomplete:</li>
					<li>after various tag autocomplete async work, fetch timings get a complete overhaul this week. the intention is for a/c jobs to appear as fast as possible, with good ui feedback, without interrupting ui while they work. feedback on how this works IRL would be appreciated</li>
					<li>there are now just two autocomplete options under options->speed and memory:</li>
					<li>- whether autocomplete results are ever fetched automatically, defaults to true</li>
					<li>- the max number of characters in the input that will cause just exact results vs. full autocomplete results, defaults to 2, can be None</li>
					<li>namespaces are no longer searched from an unnamespaced query ('char' no longer matches 'character:samus aran'). this proved too slow for real use, and remains better available with explicit namespace searches such as 'character:' or 'char*:*'</li>
					<li>the 'exact results' character limit now also applies to subtags of namespace searches! so, entering 'character:a' will deliver the same short exact match results as just 'a'--no more gigantic lists when you put in a simple namespace</li>
					<li>improved tag results caching to deal with the new non-namespace matching on subtag input</li>
					<li>tag autocomplete dropdowns will now display a non-selectable 'loading results...' label when results take more than 200ms to load.</li>
					<li>tag autocomplete dropdowns will now also display 'static' tags, such as 'namespace:*anything*' for 'read' inputs and the exact entered text and possible siblings/parents for 'write' inputs, during loading. so, typing 'character:' just to get the special 'character:*anything*' predicate is now simple and does not need a whole load wait to enter!</li>
					<li>cleaned up some tag listbox code to handle parent selection and navigation better along with the new label type</li>
					<li>greatly improved autocomplete search logic in the critical text search portion, collapsing it into one cleverer and more easily cancellable query rather than two or three simpler ones with potentially gigantic lists thrown back and forth</li>
					<li>improved speed of autocomplete cancel for certain large lists with many siblings</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>file maintenance:</li>
					<li>the new file maintenance ui now shows scheduled jobs in a listctrl, and only shows jobs that have outstanding work. you can clear/do work on multiple selected jobs</li>
					<li>the file manager should now try to guarantee at least 644 permission on file imports (previously, it was only trying to add 600, which lead to problems with nocopy ipfs running on another user etc...)</li>
					<li>added a file maintenance job to check and fix file permissions</li>
					<li>added a file maintenance job to regenerate similar files metadata</li>
					<li>added a file maintenance job to check if a file should be in the similar files system--if it should and isn't, it is queued to get its metadata data regenerated, and if it is and shouldn't be, it is removed</li>
					<li>the previous bulky similar files metadata regen job from the duplicates page is now removed, and any outstanding scheduled regen will be transferred to the new file maintenance manager on update</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>client api:</li>
					<li>added POST /manage_pages/focus_page, which makes the given page the current page in the main gui</li>
					<li>added help and unit tests for this new call</li>
					<li>client api is now version 9</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>fixed an issue recording media viewtimes when no max viewtime is set</li>
					<li>fixed the new missingdirectory errors not printing the missing path</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with some human-started repository actions waiting silently on bandwidth when it was not intended (e.g. account refresh)</li>
					<li>export folders now raise proper errors and pause themselves if their path is not set, does not exist on the file system, or is not a directory (previously, they silently stopped work without error)</li>
					<li>cleaned up some misc import folder code, and put in additional protections to the delete/move code to ensure folders cannot be so actioned if they somehow end up in the path import queue</li>
					<li>when unpinning a file or directory from ipfs, the clientside service now first checks that the current daemon considers it pinned (previously, this 500 errored when the object was not pinned due to a reinitialised daemon etc...)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the new ipfs path translation control, which was forgetting values when the clientside path was outside of the default db structure</li>
					<li>media objects that transition from trashed to physically deleted but remain in view will now correctly be aware of their complete previously-deleted status (rather than being simply remote, as they were before until a client restart)</li>
					<li>improved some of the recent duplicates db update code to pre-optimise the new tables on update (some users were getting slow behaviour due to mis-scheduled analysis maintenance)</li>
					<li>extended the new panel system to deal with custom button panels and moved the duplicate filter 'commit and continue?' dialog to the new panel system</li>
					<li>moved the archive/delete and duplicate filter 'commit and finish' dialog to the new panel system</li>
					<li>wrote a new question panel for the typical yes/no dialog used across the program and started a cleanup job to migrate all 140-odd instances of this over</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where a program instance that quit due to a user deciding to leave an already running instance in place would clear the original instance's 'running' file in its shutdown, meaning subsequent runs would charge ahead and hit 'database is locked' problems on db init!</li>
					<li>wrote a new 'similar files metadata generation report mode' to provide debug info on this cpu/gpu intensive routine</li>
					<li>added 'why use sqlite?' entry to the help faq, with a link to prkc's excellent document about the subject, https://gitgud.io/prkc/hydrus-why-sqlite/blob/master/README.md</li>
					<li>also added prkc's excellent Linux package requirements information to the 'running from source' help page</li>
					<li>fixed some old py 2.7 references in running from source help and an old link in ipfs help</li>
					<li>moved the 'file viewing statistics' menu down on the database menu</li>
					<li>fixed some dialog Escape key event handling</li>
					<li>fixed some ui ancestory testing code</li>
					<li>improved some misc similar files system code</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 359</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>ipfs nocopy:</li>
					<li>wrote a new panel to better show ipfs daemon status and added it to the review and manage ipfs service panels</li>
					<li>added nocopy config review and enable status and buttons to this new panel</li>
					<li>added an EXPERIMENTAL 'use nocopy' checkbox to the ipfs manage services panel</li>
					<li>added accompanying WEWLAD path translation ui to enable nocopy when your hydrus media storage paths are inaccessible to the ipfs daemon for nocopy purposes. a help button explains this more--it currently needs some symlinking, so non-advanced users should stay away</li>
					<li>if everything is set up, ipfs nocopy seems to work! I am not totally happy about the setup required here, so feedback from advanced ipfs-fluent users would be appreciated and we can iterate on this</li>
					<li>improved stability of ipfs daemon/version checking code</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>file maintenance:</li>
					<li>wrote some proper file maintenance ui under database->maintain->review scheduled file maintenance!</li>
					<li>for existing work, the new file maintenance ui shows how much work is scheduled for each job type and lets you cancel that work or run it manually</li>
					<li>for new work, the new file maintenance ui lets you queue up work of any type for files you select with the standard tag autocomplete search interface! you can schedule all pngs to be rescanned in case they are truly apngs, or regen thumbs for all files imported before a certain date, or whatever you wish. you can also queue up repository update files</li>
					<li>the file maintenance manager can now deal with repository update files when it does a complete file metadata regen</li>
					<li>the file maintenance manager now takes responsibility for checking file presence and file integrity. the old 'check file integrity' options under database->maintenance, which did all files in one go, are now gone</li>
					<li>file integrity checks will now always export broken files and missing/broken files' known urls to .txt files to your db_dir/missing_and_invalid_files. appropriate popups and log data will be sent as well. also, the known urls will be both exported on a per-file .txt basis and appended to one unified .txt</li>
					<li>if a file now fails to parse on a metadata reparse, it is now automatically checked for file data integrity</li>
					<li>if a repository encounters a missing, invalid, or incorrect filetype update during update processing, it now schedules all updates in the repo to be appropriately rescanned by the file maintenance manager</li>
					<li>if the storage subdirectory directory does not exist on a client file path request or thumbnail-add attempt, a special error will now be raised with instructions to reconnect the location or shut the client down immediately</li>
					<li>cleaned up some ffmpeg mime-detection logspam</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>duplicates:</li>
					<li>added several single-file thumbnail right-click dissolve/reset duplicate actions:</li>
					<li>- reset search status</li>
					<li>- remove from duplicate group (if in one and not the king)</li>
					<li>- dissolve duplicate group (if in a group)</li>
					<li>- remove from alternate group (if in one)</li>
					<li>- dissolve alternate group (if in one)</li>
					<li>- clear false-positive relations (if it has some)</li>
					<li>added some new code to deal with dissolution and member extraction at the db level</li>
					<li>when a member is extracted from alternate group, its constituent files are now requeued for potential search</li>
					<li>multi-selection duplicate right-click actions are now available to non-advanced-mode users</li>
					<li>wrote some unit tests for the new dissolve/reset actions</li>
					<li>cleaned up some misc duplicates code</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>fixed a recent bug in the file lookup script GET call--I apologise for the mistake</li>
					<li>the main gui page tab menu now lets you sort page tabs by the number of files they have</li>
					<li>deviant art seem to be rolling out a new page format. this week hydrus introduces completely new deviant art downloader objects that, fingers crossed, will update any existing users smoothly and also provide new tag search functionality. users who are still logged in may still be getting the old page format. if this is you, and this update does not work (although I _think_ it should, even so), please try clearing your existing login and logging in again</li>
					<li>new deviant art login script, artist + tag GUGs, gallery url classes, file and gallery parsers</li>
					<li>updated the shimmie file page parser to pull source time and md5</li>
					<li>improved the 'process now' advanced button to only focus on actual specific outstanding processing. previously, it was also checking for new metadata when due, which, when the server was not available, could seemingly idle for a time before actually processing updates due to the new delaying connection retry code</li>
					<li>wrote a new 'file import report mode' mode to help->debug->report modes</li>
					<li>fixed a progress display issue with the janitorial petitions processing page</li>
					<li>improved accuracy of sibling and parent petition counts, and properly capped them at 1000</li>
					<li>mapping petitions are now grouped by namespace, and will come in more manageable chunks</li>
					<li>fixed the server launch-and-init test debug code</li>
					<li>misc string-to-string control improvements to support the new ipfs edit ui</li>
					<li>removed the old 'continual tag archive sync' legacy code from tag services, which has been semi/non-functional for a long time</li>
					<li>cleaned up the annoying separator hanging on the end of certain tag right-click menus</li>
					<li>cleared out the 'Exception ignored in' spam that is often printed after the log closes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 358</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>duplicates:</li>
					<li>the final large data storage overhaul work of the duplicates work big job is done--potential duplicate information is now stored more sensibly and efficiently. potential pair information is now stored between duplicate file groups, rather than files themselves. when duplicate file groups are merged, or alternate or false positive relationships set, potentials are merged and culled appropriately</li>
					<li>your existing potential data will be updated. the current potential pairs queue size will shrink as duplicate potential relationships are merged</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now presents file kings as comparison files when possible, increasing pair difference and decision value</li>
					<li>potential pair information is now stored with the 'distance' between the two files as found by the similar-files search system. the duplicate filter will serve files with closer distance first, which increases decision value by front-loading likely duplicates instead of alts. distance values for existing potential pair info is estimated on update, so if you have done search distance 2 or greater and would like to fill in this data accurately to get closer potentials first, you might like to reset your potential duplicates under the cog icon (bear in mind this reset will schedule a decent whack of CPU for your idle maintenance time)</li>
					<li>setting alternate relationship on a pair is now fixed more concretely, ensuring that in various search expansions or resets that the same pair will not come up again. this solves some related problems users have had trying to 'fix' larger alternate groups in place--you may see your alternates compared one last time, but that should be the final go. these fixed relationships are merged as intra-alternate group members merge due to duplicate-setting events</li>
					<li>a variety of potential duplicates code has been streamlined based on the new duplicate group relationship</li>
					<li>improved how a second-best king representative of a group is selected in various file relationship fetching jobs when the true king is not permitted by search domain</li>
					<li>one critical part of the new potential duplicates system is more complicated. if you experience much slower searches or count retrievals IRL, please let me know your details</li>
					<li>expanded duplicates unit tests to test potential counts for all tested situations</li>
					<li>fixed a bug where alternate group merging would not cull now-invalid false-positive potential pairs</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>updated the default pixiv parser to work with their new format--thank you to a user for providing this fix</li>
					<li>fixed the issue where mouse scroll events were not being processed by the main viewer canvas when it did not have focus</li>
					<li>file page parsers that produce multiple urls through subsidiary page parsers now correctly pass down associated urls and tags to their child file import items</li>
					<li>updated to wx 4.0.6 on all built platforms--looks like a bunch of bug fixes, so fingers-crossed this improves some stability and jank</li>
					<li>updated the recent server access-key-arg-parsing routine to check access from the header before parsing args, which fixes an issue with testing decompression bomb permission on file POST requests on the file repository. generally improved code here to deal more gracefully with failures</li>
					<li>the repositories now max out at 1000 count when fetching pending petition counts (speeding up access when there are large queues)</li>
					<li>the repositories now fetch petitions much faster when there are large queues</li>
					<li>frames and dialogs will be slightly more aggressive about ensuring their parents now get focus back when they are closed (rather than the top level main gui, which sometimes happens due to window manager weirdness)</li>
					<li>rewrote a bad old legacy method of refocusing the manage tags panel that kicks in when the 'open manage tags' action is processed by the media viewer canvas but the panel is already open</li>
					<li>hitting 'refresh account' on a paused service now gives a better immediate message rather than failing after delay on a confusing 'bad login' error</li>
					<li>improved login errors' text to specify the exact problem raised by the login manager</li>
					<li>fixed a problem in the duplicates page when a status update is called before the initial db status fetch is complete</li>
					<li>the manage tag siblings panel now detects if the pair you wish to add connects to a loop already in the database (which is a rare but possible case). previously it would hang indefinitely! it now cancels the add, communicates the tags in the loop, and recommends you break it manually</li>
					<li>added a link to https://github.com/cravxx/hydrus.js , a node.js module that plugs into the client api, to the help</li>
					<li>a variety of user-started network jobs such as refreshing account and testing a server connection under manage services now only attempt connection once (to fail faster as the user waits)</li>
					<li>the 'test address' job under manage services is now asynchronous and will not hang the ui while it waits for a response</li>
					<li>fixed some unstable thread-to-wx code under the 'test access key' job under manage services</li>
					<li>improved some file handling to ensure open files are closed more promptly in certain circumstances</li>
					<li>fixed some unstable thread-to-wx communication in the ipfs review services panel</li>
					<li>improved the accuracy of the network engine's 'incomplete download' test and bandwidth reporting to work with exact byte counts when available, regardless of content encoding. downloads that provide too few bytes in ways that were previously not caught will be reattempted according to the normal connection reattempt rules. these network fixes may solve some broken jpegs and json some users have seen from unreliable servers</li>
					<li>fixed watcher entries in the watcher page list not reporting their file and check download status as they work (as the gallery downloader does)</li>
					<li>the client api will now deliver cleaner 400 errors when a given url argument is empty or otherwise fails to normalise (previously it was giving 500s)</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 357</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>client api:</li>
					<li>the client api can now receive the access key through a GET or POST parameter rather than the header</li>
					<li>the client api now supports GET /session_key, which provides a temporary key that gives the same access as its permanent access key with the Hydrus-Client-API-Session-Key name through header or GET/POST param. it expires after 24 hours of inactivity or if the client is restarted</li>
					<li>the GET /manage_pages/get_pages call now returns the unique 'page_key' identifier that will be useful in future page management when multiple pages share a name</li>
					<li>the POST /add_urls/add_url command now takes 'destination_page_key' to exactly specify which page you would like a URL to end up on. if the page is not found, or it is the incorrect type, the standard page selection/creation rules will apply</li>
					<li>cleaned up some serverside request processing code</li>
					<li>cleaned up some misc client api permission checking code</li>
					<li>updated client unit tests to check the new changes</li>
					<li>updated client api help to reflect the new changes</li>
					<li>cleaned up some GET and POST parameter parsing</li>
					<li>client api version is now 8</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>shortcut and hover window fixes:</li>
					<li>moved the canvas shortcut processing code more towards the new shortcut system</li>
					<li>the OS X shortcut-in-media-viewer issue, which was being boshed in a similar way to the main gui last week, should now be fixed</li>
					<li>when the hover windows have focus, they now pass shortcuts up to the canvas parent more reliably</li>
					<li>removed a legacy menu highlight-tracking system that was malfunctioning and generally throwing a slow-memory-leaking wrench in several places, particularly some non-Windows situations</li>
					<li>the 'menubar is open' test code is now only active for Windows. the other platforms have mixed reliability with menubar open/close events</li>
					<li>some related OS X hover-window flickering and hiding-under the main page problems (having problems due to thinking menus were open) are also fixed</li>
					<li>some hover window flicker on certain focus changes due to clicking focus windows should be fixed</li>
					<li>hover windows now try to size themselves a little better on init, which reduces some initial flicker or false-positive single-frame display on some systems</li>
					<li>extended the hover report mode to report some 'ideal' pos/size info as well</li>
					<li>under file->shortcuts, custom shortcuts are now hidden for non-advanced-mode users</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>the popup message toaster now always shows its 'dismiss all' summary bar whenever any messages are being displayed. the summary bar now also has a ▼/▲ button to collapse/expand its messages!</li>
					<li>added duplicate comparison score options (under options->duplicates) for the new jpeg quality estimator</li>
					<li>fixed the default duplicate comparison score values, which appeared to be reversed for higher vs much higher--they will be reset to these new defaults on update, so recheck them if you prefer different</li>
					<li>in manage tag siblings and parents, the filename tagging dialog, and some misc options panels, tag autocomplete input controls now have 'paste' buttons to make entering many results much easier</li>
					<li>to reduce update flicker, the downloader and watcher pages do not list seconds in their 'added' column ('12 minutes 24 seconds ago' is now '12 minutes ago')</li>
					<li>improved clipboard access cleanup on in-clipboard errors, which was sometimes leading to error popups or clipboard lockup</li>
					<li>rather than the simple 'yes', the review bandwidth usage dialog now puts the waiting estimate (like '12 minutes 50 seconds') in the 'blocked?' column</li>
					<li>improved external program launch code for non-Windows to remove hydrus-specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH completely when no OS default exists to restore it to. this should fix ffmpeg connection for certain installs</li>
					<li>fixed a rare bug when initial media results of a page failed to load due to a subset of unexpectedly unfetchable file records</li>
					<li>gave the rare 'ui freezup on dialog close' event yet another pass. closing via escape key should now be immune to this</li>
					<li>'remote' files that were once in the client but since deleted now have the 'trashed' icon and will state so on their right-click info summary lines</li>
					<li>fixed various instances where selection-from-list dialogs were failing to sort their list based on underlying data object uncomparibility. an example of this was when selecting which queries to pull from a separating subscription</li>
					<li>on the edit parser panels, fetching test data successfully via the quick button or the manual URL entry will now set that URL in the example parsing context</li>
					<li>on the edit parser panels, the subsidiary page parser's separation formula now launches with the correct example data (the original data from the parent dialog, rather than the post-separated data) on which to test separation. this should nest correctly for multiple subsidiary page parsers</li>
					<li>to reduce server load spikes, clientside petition processing now approves very large mapping and file petitions (such as a petition to delete one tag from 50k files) as a sequence of smaller chunks</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 356</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>duplicates:</li>
					<li>moved better/worse/same quality duplicates relationships to the new 'king' group-based model. rather than tracking every relationship, duplicates are now stored in groups with a single 'best' file</li>
					<li>as a result, duplicate relationships are now transitive! saying that one king is duplicate to another will merge groups. the 'better' king is the new king, and 'same quality' kings choose one of the kings pseudorandomly. advanced exceptions: saying that a king is better than a basic member of another group or saying that two members are same quality is still valid but will simply 'poach' the non-king member from the other group in order to ensure the wrong king doesn't end up on top in the eventual merge. saying KingA is same quality as MemberB will merge the groups with KingB as the new king (since it is presumably same/better quality to all members of A)</li>
					<li>the thumbnail right-click 'duplicates' entry is now renamed to 'file relationships' and is no longer advanced mode only. the 'find similar files' entry is folded into this</li>
					<li>the thumbnail 'file relationships' menu now shows a simple 'duplicates' count rather than the old messy better/worse/equal. it will show all the members of a duplicates group when clicked. the menu also notes if the focused file is the best file of its group. if it is not, you will get the option to show the best file or make the focused file the best</li>
					<li>as a result, it is now much simpler to view a group of duplicates and overrule a 'best quality' member as needed</li>
					<li>added the 'media' shortcut 'duplicate_media_set_focused_king' to shortcut setting a 'best quality' file</li>
					<li>the system:num duplicate relationships now has the simpler 'duplicates' entry, to search on size of the entire group. searching for kings/not kings will come soon</li>
					<li>due to the new duplicate transitivity rules, potential pairs are now eliminated at a much faster rate!</li>
					<li>setting duplicate relationships will overrule false positive or alternate relationships already in place</li>
					<li>manually setting alternate relationships to more than two thumbnails at once will now set each file as alternate to every other file in the selection, completely eliminating potential pairs within the group. if you try to do this to large groups of files you will get a longer yes/no confirmation message just to make sure you aren't overwriting some potential dupes by accident</li>
					<li>all existing better/worse/same relationships will be converted to the new group storage in this update, with appropriate kings determined. potential pair queue counts will be reduce accordingly, and the temporary alternate/duplicate confusion from the alternates update will be auto-resolved by merging truly duplicate 'alternates' together</li>
					<li>fleshed out the duplicate test code significantly to handle the new dupe groups and their interactions with the recent false positive and alternates changes</li>
					<li>refactored some db test code into separate client/server/duplicates files and cleaned up dupe tests readability</li>
					<li>potential pairs are now the only component of the new system still on the old pairs system. the duplicate filter will still serve up some inefficient (i.e. non-king) comparisons</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>fixed the issue where many clipboard-watcher-caught URLs that did not match were producing false-positive 'could not generate new page for that URL' error popups</li>
					<li>the clipboard text-fetcher now tests against incompatible clipboard types (like a screenshot) better, and all instances of text fetching now report errors more gracefully and with more information</li>
					<li>fixed the unusual OS X issue where many shortcuts were not being processed after client boot until the top menubar was opened and closed. a variety of other blocking-while-menubar-is-open issues that were false-positive misfiring are now fixed as well, please let me know if you still have trouble here</li>
					<li>the file menu now has an 'exit and force shutdown maintenance' option to force-run outstanding maintenance jobs</li>
					<li>when shutdown maintenance work is going on, the shutdown splash screen now has a 'stop shutdown maintenance' button!</li>
					<li>cleaned up some file maintenance manager maintenance locking and shutdown cancel logic</li>
					<li>moved all the idle-mode maintenance checks to a new system that explicitly defines idle/shutdown/forced maintenance work and tests those states in a unified manner, checking idle mode and the new splash cancel button status and so on more reliably. a lot of maintenance should cancel out quicker when appropriate</li>
					<li>misc shutdown logic cleanup</li>
					<li>added a 'file maintenance' option to the database->maintenance menu that forces the new file maintenance manager to run its queue. it'll make a little popup as it works, or a note that no work is due</li>
					<li>the 'regenerate' thumbnail menu is also available to all users</li>
					<li>jpeg quality estimates are now available for all users in the duplicate filter. they only display when the two jpegs' quality have different labels</li>
					<li>the jpeg quality estimator now handles some unusual jpegs that load with empty quantization table arrays</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now handles bad jpeg quality estimations gracefully</li>
					<li>cleaned up some ffmpeg communication code</li>
					<li>the ffmpeg debug text that spawns on a help->about call that fails to discover ffmpeg version information now prints stderr output as well. if you have been hit by this, please give it another go and let me know what you get</li>
					<li>the same ffmpeg 'no response' error on file parse now popups and prints some debug info and returns a better error</li>
					<li>dialogs and windows on the new panel system now support a new pre-close tidying system</li>
					<li>the manage tags dialog and window will now cancel any pending large tag autocomplete queries on close</li>
					<li>regular gui pages now support a new pre-close tidying system</li>
					<li>search pages will now cancel any pending search results loading or tag autocomplete queries on close</li>
					<li>improved reliability of the popup message manager chasing the main gui when it is sent to another screen by a keyboard shortcut (such as shift+win+arrow on Windows). it should work now if the mouse cursor is in either window. please let me know if this causes trouble for virtual display navigation</li>
					<li>the network engine now waits significantly longer--60s--on connection errors before trying again, and with every failed attempt will wait n times longer again. when in this waiting state, a manual user cancel command cancels it out faster</li>
					<li>I believe I have fixed/improved a situation where media viewer hover windows would sometimes disappear immediately after appearing on some Linux window managers</li>
					<li>improved hover window report mode to state more focus info in case the above is insufficient</li>
					<li>to better link the two requests and consume bandwidth under strict rules more precisely, the override bandwidth rule that kicks in when a file page has a single file is now 3 seconds instead of 30</li>
					<li>updated options->connection page to specify that 'socks4a'/'socks5h' is needed to force remote dns resolution</li>
					<li>sped up tag parents initialisation</li>
					<li>repositories now group tag sibling and parent petitions by the parent/better tag's namespace</li>
					<li>removed some old network 'death time' code that is no longer useful and was interfering with heavy petition processing</li>
					<li>the log now flushes itself to disk every 60s rather than 300s</li>
					<li>misc fixes and cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 355</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>duplicates:</li>
					<li>retuned the new alternate and false positive setting code to be less aggressive about removing potential pairs. users with alternate groups who updated to 354 may have lost some intra-alternate potential pairs, which I expect to fill back in once the potential pairs system is updated</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter center-right hover window now has a trash button, which is moved to its own row with the cog icon where they will fit on thinner windows better</li>
					<li>users who are in advanced mode now have access to duplicate merge options for 'alternates' again--but be careful with this, it is advanced. if you had merge options for alternates set up before, your old options _should_ return, but make sure to check it</li>
					<li>if you are in advanced mode, the duplicate filter can now show an experimental jpeg quality comparison statement. if this works out, I will add custom scores and improve this otherwise based on feedback , so comments would be appreciated</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>client api:</li>
					<li>the client api has a new 'manage pages' permission!</li>
					<li>/manage_pages/get_pages now fetches a structure of the current page session! there's some help for it</li>
					<li>in future, I expect to add a 'select page' command and get/remove/highlight URL(s) for downloader pages, and reveal the unique page identifier for better targeting here and for add_url commands</li>
					<li>client api is now version 7</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>fixed a stupid issue related to drawing collection thumbnails that was causing a lot of errors. I apologise for the inconvenience and have added pre-build tests to catch these simple mistakes in future</li>
					<li>added a clipboard url watcher! there are two options now under network->downloaders--one for watcher urls, and one for all other _recognised_ urls (i.e. post and gallery urls, and file urls that have matching url classes). it checks every second, sends urls to pages according to the same rules as a drag and drop event, and will handle newline-separated lists of urls</li>
					<li>when the client is minimised and needs to create a new downloader page because of an 'add url' command through this new clipboard watcher or the client api, it will now queue up the url and its page creation for when the client is next restored (page creation while minimized causes layout bugs). it returns an appropriate result text to the client api in this case</li>
					<li>added four 'show_and_focus_manage_tags_XXX' shortcuts to the 'main_gui' shortcut set that let you select and focus the four possible suggested tags panels on the manage tags dialog. these are slightly special focus events that do some 'first tag selection' work as well and should let you make the whole process keyboard-only</li>
					<li>added a 'focus_media_viewer' shortcut to the 'main_gui' shortcut set that focuses the media viewer from a media viewer's manage tags window</li>
					<li>file viewing statistics gets an update: it now has its own options page where you can set min/max for preview and media viewing times. the global turn on/off control is moved from database menu to this page, as is a new control for enabling it on the duplicate filter (where you will be flicking back and forth and perhaps do not want lots of views recorded). duplicate filter file stats now default to disabled</li>
					<li>added a new command to database->file viewing statistics that will cull your current stats based on the new min/max values to compensate for previous accidental '3day 4hour' preview view that snuck in. a yes/no dialog explains how it works before it goes</li>
					<li>wrote a 'mixin' class to let my buttons automatically note current shortcut mapping information to the bottom of button tooltips</li>
					<li>the duplicate commands and a variety of other media viewer buttons that work in the new shortcut system now report their current shortcuts in their tooltips!</li>
					<li>quick-entering 'namespace:' in a search page's tag autocomplete input will now automatically swap in the special 'namespace:*anything*' predicate</li>
					<li>cleaned up code around setting a custom temp_dir through the "temp_dir" command, and made it test the given path is indeed a directory and writable-to. if not, the program dumps out with an error popup</li>
					<li>the client and server now similarly test that the directory db is a dir and writable-to</li>
					<li>rearranged some critical boot error handling code and made the client's boot error handling throw up some ui</li>
					<li>fixed the client's repairdb function when needing to regen autocomplete caches</li>
					<li>autocomplete regen now publishes status updates to the splash screen</li>
					<li>fixed the client's repairdb to wait correctly for the ui in case the user wants to bail before repair</li>
					<li>the client's repair db now repairs the new local_tags_cache table if missing</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with showing the manage logins panel when the domain had some unusual cookie expiry numbers</li>
					<li>to reduce initial load gui-event crunch (which affects some systems' layout reliability), initial session load now happens after a 0.5s delay</li>
					<li>cleaned up some image load error handling</li>
					<li>when FFMPEG version information cannot be understood in help->about, a popup note appears and debug information is printed to the log</li>
					<li>the advanced content update panel now puts up a 'working...' dialog while it processed a job</li>
					<li>in the client</li>
					<li>all 4XX and 5XX network exceptions' error texts are now prepended with the actual status code</li>
					<li>extended the hover window debug report mode</li>
					<li>improved some misc temp and permission testing code</li>
					<li>improved some misc testing code</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 354</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>duplicates important:</li>
					<li>duplicates 'false positive' and 'alternates' pairs are now stored in a new more efficient structure that is better suited for larger groups of files</li>
					<li>alternate relationships are now implicitly transitive--if A is alternate B and A is alternate C, B is now alternate C</li>
					<li>false positive relationships remain correctly non-transitive, but they are now implicitly shared amongst alternates--if A is alternate B and A is false positive with C, B is now false positive with C. and further, if C alt D, then A and B are implicitly fp D as well!</li>
					<li>your existing false positive and alternates relationships will be migrated on update. alternates will apply first, so in the case of conflicts due to previous non-excellent filtering workflow, formerly invalid false positives (i.e. false positives between now-transitive alternates) will be discarded. invalid potentials will also be cleared out</li>
					<li>attempting to set a 'false positives' or 'alternates' relationship to files that already have a conflicting relation (e.g. setting false positive to two files that already have alternates) now does nothing. in future, this will have graceful failure reporting</li>
					<li>the false positive and alternate transitivity clears out potential dupes at a faster rate than previously, speeding up duplicate filter workflow and reducing redundancy on the human end</li>
					<li>unfortunately, as potential and better/worse/same pairs have yet to be updated, the system may report that a file has the same alternate as same quality partner. this will be automatically corrected in the coming weeks</li>
					<li>when selecting 'view this file's duplicates' from thumbnail right-click, the focus file will now be the first file displayed in the next page</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>duplicates boring details:</li>
					<li>setting 'false positive' and 'alternates' status now accounts for the new data storage, and a variety of follow-on assumptions and transitive properties (such as implying other false positive relationships or clearing out potential dupes between two groups of merging alternates) are now dealt with more rigorously (and moreso when I move the true 'duplicate' file relationships over)</li>
					<li>fetching file duplicate status counts, file duplicate status hashes, and searching for system:num_dupes now accounts for the new data storage r.e. false positives and alternates</li>
					<li>new potential dupes are culled when they conflict with the new transitive alternate and false positive relationships</li>
					<li>removed the code that fudges explicit transitive 'false positive' and 'alternate' relationships based on existing same/better/worse pairs when setting new dupe pairs. this temporary gap will be filled back in in the coming weeks (clearing out way more potentials too)</li>
					<li>several specific advanced duplicate actions are now cleared out to make way for future streamlining of the filter workflow:</li>
					<li>removed the 'duplicate_media_set_false_positive' shortcut, which is an action only appropriate when viewing confirmed potentials through the duplicate filter (or after the ' show random pairs' button)</li>
					<li>removed the 'duplicate_media_remove_relationships' shortcut and menu action ('remove x pairs ... from the dupes system'), which will return as multiple more precise and reliable 'dissolve' actions in the coming weeks</li>
					<li>removed the 'duplicate_media_reset_to_potential' shortcut and menu action ('send the x pairs ... to be compared in the duplicates filter') as it was always buggy and lead to bloating of the filter queue. it is likely to return as part of the 'dissolve'-style reset commands as above</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where hitting 'duplicate_media_set_focused_better' shortcut with no focused thumb would throw an error</li>
					<li>started proper unit tests for the duplicates system and filled in the phash search, basic current better/worse, and false positive and alternate components</li>
					<li>various incidences of duplicate 'action options' and similar phrasing are now unified to 'metadata merge options'</li>
					<li>cleaned up 'unknown/potential' phrasing in duplicate pair code and some related duplicate filter code</li>
					<li>cleaned up wording and layout of the thumbnail duplicates menu</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>tag blacklists in downloaders' tag import options now apply to the parsed tags both before and after a tag sibling collapse. it uses the combined tag sibling rules, so feedback on how well this works irl would be appreciated</li>
					<li>I believe I fixed the annoying issue where a handful of thumbnails would sometimes inexplicitly not fade in after during thumbgrid scrolling (and typically on first thumb load--this problem was aggravated by scroll/thumb-render speed ratio)</li>
					<li>when to-be-regenerated thumbnails are taken off the thumbnail waterfall queue due to fast scrolling or page switching, they are now queued up in the new file maintenance system for idle-time work!</li>
					<li>the main gui menus will now no longer try to update while they are open! uploading pending tags while lots of new tags are coming in is now much more reliable. let me know if you discover a way to get stuck in this frozen state!</li>
					<li>cleaned up some main gui menu regeneration code, reducing the total number of stub objects created and deleted, particularly when the 'pending' menu refreshes its label frequently while uploading many pending tags. should be a bit more stable for some linux flavours</li>
					<li>the 'fix siblings and parents' button on manage tags is now a menu button with two options--for fixing according to the 'all services combined' siblings and parents or just for the current panel's service. this overrides the 'apply sibs/parents across all services' options. this will be revisited in future when more complicated sibling application rules are added</li>
					<li>the 'hide and anchor mouse' check under 'options->media' is no longer windows-only, if you want to test it, and the previous touchscreen-detecting override (which unhid and unanchored on vigorous movement) is now optional, defaulting to off</li>
					<li>greatly reduced typical and max repository pre-processing disk cache time and reworked stop calculations to ensure some work always gets done</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with 'show some random dupes' thumbnails not hiding on manual trashing, if that option is set. 'show some random dupes' thumbnail panels will now inherit their file service from the current duplicate search domain</li>
					<li>repository processing will now never run for more than an hour at once. this mitigates some edge-case disastrous ui-hanging outcomes and generally gives a chance for hydrus-level jobs like subscriptions and even other programs like defraggers to run even when there is a gigantic backlog of processing to do</li>
					<li>added yet another CORS header to improve Client API CORS compatibility, and fixed an overauthentication problem</li>
					<li>setting a blank string on the new local booru external port override option will now forego the host:port colon in the resultant external url. a tooltip on the control repeats this</li>
					<li>reworded and coloured the pause/play sync button in review services repository panel to be more clear about current paused status</li>
					<li>fixed a problem when closing the gui when the popup message manager is already closed by clever OS-specific means</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup</li>
					<li>updated sqlite on windows to 3.28.0</li>
					<li>updated upnpc exe on windows to 2.1</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 353</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>duplicate filter:</li>
					<li>duplicate action options no longer handle file deletion</li>
					<li>renamed 'not duplicates' across the program to 'not related' or 'false positive'</li>
					<li>'alternates' and 'not related/false positive' duplicate actions no longer have duplicate action options. no merge content update now occurs on these actions</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter hover panel now splits 'this is better' decisions into two buttons--whether to delete or keep the worse file</li>
					<li>when selecting 'custom action' in the duplicate filter hover panel, it now asks if you would like to delete the current file, the other file, or both</li>
					<li>the 'duplicate_filter_this_is_better' shortcut action will be auto-updated to 'duplicate_filter_this_is_better_and_delete_other'. an alternate 'duplicate_filter_this_is_better_but_keep_both' is now also available</li>
					<li>the 'duplicate_filter_not_dupes' shortcut action will be auto-updated to 'duplicate_filter_false_positive'</li>
					<li>separated the buttons on the duplicate filter hover panel to more carefully split 'yes, files are duplicates' vs other decisions</li>
					<li>in prep for the duplicate db overhaul, refactored all PHash search code and Duplicate management code apart</li>
					<li>misc other prep work for duplicate db overhaul</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>file maintenance:</li>
					<li>wrote a new unified manager to handle various long-term file maintenance tasks like regenerating file metadata and thumbnails</li>
					<li>options to govern how this manager can run are now in options->maintenance and processing. you can enable it for idle and shutdown maintenance time and give it a throttle to limit how fast it will work on files, defaulting to 200 per day</li>
					<li>unified the previous db-level attempts at file maintenance to the new system, which supports async job queueing, and moving regen code up to the new manager, out of the db lock</li>
					<li>unified a variety of file and thumbnail regen code to work through the new simpler and saner path</li>
					<li>the right-click->regen thumbnail commands now run through the new manager and no longer need a modal popup. you can keep browsing while they work. they will also not hang the ui as the old system could on big jobs</li>
					<li>when right-click->regenning on more than 50 thumbnails, you now get a dialog asking if you want to do the job now or put it off later</li>
					<li>file maintenance tasks can now run in shutdown time! you will get previews of the jobs with file counts and status progress reports on the shutdown splash</li>
					<li>cleaned up some file extension renaming and dupe-removing code</li>
					<li>in future, I will move the current file integrity check to this new system and have some ui to prompt and set up other big jobs, like fixing various historical misparsing issues</li>
					<li>thumbnail resizing during thumbnail fade that resizes down is now more efficient</li>
					<li>moved the ClientFilesManager to ClientFiles.py</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>the 'manage upnp' dialog now moves the duplicated external ip display from the column up to the status text at the top. it fetches the ip after the initial mappings fetch is done. this ip is no longer affected by the external host override option</li>
					<li>cleaned up options->connection page and removed the now defunct external host override option</li>
					<li>the manage services page for the local booru now has optional override for scheme, host, and port for the 'copy external url' function</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the recent 'collect by' session saving where a restored session that needed a collect was not sorted</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with collections being sorted by approx bitrate</li>
					<li>added a new checkbox to options->sort/collect to set it so the default sort updates every time you choose a new sort anywhere</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with 'remove trashed files from view', which was incorrectly removing on 'all local files' pages</li>
					<li>the 'all local files' file domain, which is frequently confusing to new users, is now no longer an option for new file pages or the autocomplete file domain if the user is not in advanced mode</li>
					<li>the client now searches for versions of urls both with and without a final '/' character when looking up file url import status at the db level and in import lists. system:known_url is unfortunately still an inefficient mess</li>
					<li>improved how the server code deals with some connectionLost errors</li>
					<li>cleaned up and unified some older dialog button code</li>
					<li>fixed a problem in manage tag siblings when petitioning existing pairs and then cancelling when asked for a reason</li>
					<li>fixed a miscount issue when uploading pending tags while many new tags are coming in. progress would sometimes be -754/1,234, ha ha</li>
					<li>db maintenance, repository sync, and file maintenance processing will all now wake on a force idle mode call</li>
					<li>deleted some old code</li>
					<li>misc fixes and cleanup</li>
					<li>some misc gui layout fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 352</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the client now supports importing .ico files! (.cur should be supported too)</li>
					<li>finally, 'collect by' is saved for sessions! if your default collect by previously included ratings services, it will forget them this one time--please reset it under the options->sort/collect</li>
					<li>fixed the issue where the media viewer's hover windows were hovering over child dialogs (manage tags, ratings, or known urls)</li>
					<li>improved some os x hover window focus handling for the new always-on-top duplicate action window</li>
					<li>the entries on the 'sort by' list on gui pages are now subcategorised better. it should be a bit easier to find what you are looking for</li>
					<li>the 'sort by file: approximate bitrate' sort option now sorts still images as well by filesize / num_pixels</li>
					<li>to reduce confusion, sort by mime and system:mime are now renamed to 'filetype'</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the 'unclose_page' shortcut was restoring pages in reverse order (unclosing least-recently-closed-first rather than most-recently-closed-first)</li>
					<li>improved rigour of video framerate estimation</li>
					<li>stopped the video metadata parser from opting to manually frame count videos with size >128MB or num_frames estimate >2,400</li>
					<li>fixed the forced manual frame count to deal with frame counts >9999</li>
					<li>the 'ffmpeg not found' error on file import will now put up a popup message once per boot informing you of this problem more broadly and steps to address it</li>
					<li>fixed some underreporting issues with subprocess_report_mode</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with some yes/no dialogs returning 'no' on escape/window_close_button rather than 'cancel', which affected cancelability some db maintenance questions</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where media that fitted the media viewer canvas width or height exactly at 100% zoom would not respond to zoom switch events to restore non-100% zoom to 100%</li>
					<li>when a local server's CORS mode is turned on, Access-Control-Allow-Origin is now correctly added to GET/POST requests with an Origin request header</li>
					<li>improved reliability of some timestamp rendering code, which should help some users who had trouble opening cookies management page after malformed cookie import</li>
					<li>I believe I fixed an issue with 'open externally' on certain custom paths where the external program could spawn without an ui (flash projector did this). please let me know if your 'open externally' calls start making terminal windows everywhere</li>
					<li>fixed a runtime stability issue with the new duplicates page and slow-updating counts that come in after the page has been deleted</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 351</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote a new (always on top!) hover window for the duplicate filter that sits on the middle-right. the duplicate cog button and action buttons are moved to this new window, as are the file comparison statements</li>
					<li>the duplicate file comparison statements now state the relevant actual metadata along with better '>>'-style operators to highlight differences and green/red/blue colouring based on given score. it is now much easier to see and action clearly better files at-a-glance</li>
					<li>improved some hover window focus display calculations to play with the new always-on-top tech</li>
					<li>both the 'show some random dupes' button and finding dupe pairs for the filter should be a bit faster for very large search domains. the basic file search and indexing still has to run, but the second sampling step in both cases will bail out earlier once it has a decent result</li>
					<li>core image handling functions now uniformly use OpenCV (faster, more accurate) by default, falling to PIL/Pillow on errors. image importing in the client and server should be a bit faster, and some unusual image rotations should now be read correctly</li>
					<li>the server now supports OpenCV for image operations, it _should_ also still work with only PIL/Pillow, if you are running from source and cannot get it</li>
					<li>unified all thumbnail generation code and insulated it from suprises due to unexpectedly-sized source files, fixing a potential client-level thumbnail generation looping bug</li>
					<li>gave all image processing a refactor and general cleanup pass, deleted a bunch of old code</li>
					<li>wrote a new 'local tag cache' for the db that will speed up tag definition lookups for all local files. this should speed up a variety of tag and file result fetching, particularly right after client boot. it will take a minute or two on update to generate</li>
					<li>sped up how fast the tag parent structure builds itself</li>
					<li>the review services panel now uses nested notebooks, rather than the old badly coded listbook control. I don't really like how it looks, but the code is now saner</li>
					<li>similar-files metadata generation now discards blank frames more reliably</li>
					<li>subscription popups now report x/y progress in terms of the current job, discarding historical work previously done. 1001/1003 is gone, 1/3 is in</li>
					<li>made the disk cache more conservative on non-pre-processing calls</li>
					<li>cleaned up some file import code, moving responsibility from the file locations manager to the file import object</li>
					<li>updated the ipfs service listctrl to use the new listctrl object. also cleaned up its action code to be more async and stable</li>
					<li>I believe I fixed a rare vector for the 'tryendmodal' dialog bug</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in presenting the available importable downloader objects in the easy drag-and-drop downloader import when the multiple downloaders dropped included objects of the same type and name--duplicate-named objects in this case will now be discarded</li>
					<li>unified url_match/url_class code differences to url class everywhere</li>
					<li>updated some common db list selection code to use new python string formatting</li>
					<li>plenty of misc code cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 350</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the duplicate filter no longer applies the implicit system limit (which defaults to 10,000 files) on its search domains, which solves the undercounting issue on large search domains. duplicate operations will be appropriately slower, so narrow your duplicate file queries (adding a creator: tag works great) if they take too long</li>
					<li>fixed the duplicate pairs filter's 'ghost pair' issue. it was failing, when 'both files' was unchecked, to remove pairs that included one file that was non-local. this accidental inclusion resulted in incorrect non-zero count and filter/random pairs that could not display correctly</li>
					<li>insulated against potential future iterations of this problem (likely that one of the pair was deleted by another process while a filter is ongoing), with a notification and graceful exiting of the duplicate filter while saving progress</li>
					<li>the 'show random duplicates' button now puts the 'base' of the group (to which all the others are potentially matched) as the first thumbnail</li>
					<li>added a new 'advanced file deletion' section to 'files and trash' options page to turn on a new advanced dialog and set custom file deletion reasons</li>
					<li>if this new dialog is turned on, a delete event from thumbnail grid, regular media viewer, or the duplicate filter's manual delete will launch it. it permits you to delete physically (skipping trash) in one step or delete physically without leaving a deletion record (for easier later re-import) and choose one of the deletion reasons in the new options panel or set a one-time custom reason</li>
					<li>export folders now have more run-controls: 'run regularly', 'paused', and 'run now'</li>
					<li>the file menu now has a 'run export folder now' submenu just like for import folders-- it is simple now to set up an export folder that only runs when you tell it to</li>
					<li>updated the on-boot missing file folder recovery process to automatically 'heal' file location mappings when a missing folder is actually in a location that is known (essentially, you can now manually move a bunch of folders from one known location to another while the client is off and it will recover automatically now). error dialogs will appear in this case summarising the problem and proposed fixes with a chance to bail out if you do not want it to happen</li>
					<li>added a new frame type to 'gui' options page called 'regular_center_dialog' for yes/no style dialogs that are better in the center of the parent window</li>
					<li>the custom web browser launch path and file type 'open externally' paths are moved from 'files and trash' to a new 'external programs' options page</li>
					<li>as the superior '--temp_path' program launch parameter now exists for both client and server, I have removed the limited 'BUGFIX: temp folder override' option from the client's 'files and trash' page and use in the actual code. if this option was important to you, please migrate to the --temp_path launch parameter, which covers temp usage more comprehensively</li>
					<li>as the artstation downloader is now non-functional, apparently by a cloudflare issue, the default gug for new users (and anyone with artstation set atm) is now safebooru</li>
					<li>added dolphin file manager add-on link to the client api help</li>
					<li>some misc file metadata fetching cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 349</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>duplicate filter:</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter page now has a full-on real-deal file search object to narrow down the duplicate filter, potential duplicate count, and 'show some random dupes' search domains! it also has a 'both files match' checkbox that determines if one of both files of the potential pairs should match the search!</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter page has multiple layout changes as a result:</li>
					<li>the main management area is now split into two pages--'preparation', for doing maintenance and discovery work, and 'filtering', for actioning the potential dupe pairs found</li>
					<li>the 'filtering' page will select by default, but if 'preparation' needs work, its name will become 'preparation (needs work)'</li>
					<li>the 'filtering' page now has file search ui and the 'both files' checkbox instead of the file domain button. this search data is saved on a per-page basis</li>
					<li>the two pages' status texts are now updated on separate calls which have been rewritten to be asynchronous (with 'updating...' text while they work). both now have explicit refresh buttons to force them to update</li>
					<li>the additional non-unknown pair counts listed on the filter area, which were irrelevant to filtering and sometimes confusing, are now gone. it only lists the 'unknown' pair number</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter page's help button no longer has the awful 'simple help' entry. the full html help will get a pass in the coming weeks to reflect the new search changes</li>
					<li>the duplicate file db code received significant refactoring and improvement to support searching the potential dupe space while cross-referencing the new file search context (and still falling back to the fast code when the search is just blank/system:everything)</li>
					<li>misc duplicate file db code cleanup and refactoring</li>
					<li>while in advanced mode, you can no longer select 'all known files' file domain for an export folder (and now the duplicate filter page) search context</li>
					<li>making a file delete action in the duplicate filter (by hitting delete key or the button on the top hover window, which both trigger a dialog asking to delete one or both) now auto-skips the current pair</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>manage tags:</li>
					<li>the manage tags has a new 'siblings and parents' button that will auto-replace incorrect siblings and auto-add missing parents! it works on multi-file selections as well! it gives you a summary yes/no dialog before it fires</li>
					<li>the manage tags dialog has a little logic cleanup r.e. siblings and parents and their cog auto-apply options. the auto-application now only applies on add/pend actions</li>
					<li>the manage tags dialog has a new cog button option to not trigger 'remove' actions from an autocomplete dropdown or suggested tag input action when the tag already exists</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>gave video metadata parsing another pass--it now detects 'hidden' incorrect framerates due to advanced 'skip frame' codec settings and is more accurate at determining frame count and duration, including some fixed offset calculations that was sometimes adding or discounting a few frames</li>
					<li>manual video frame count, when needed, is now faster and produces better error text</li>
					<li>fixed a critical bug in thumbnail regen that was sometimes potentially looping regen on files with unusual rotation exif information</li>
					<li>significant improvements to how the client file manager handles thumbnail identifier information, saving a great deal of time for file import and thumbnail regeneration code of videos</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where regenerated file metadata was not propagating up to the ui level in real time</li>
					<li>cleaned up some thumbnail cache initialisation code</li>
					<li>the 'generate video thumbs this % in' option is moved from the 'media' to 'thumbnails' options page</li>
					<li>to simplify code, and in prep for the idle-maintenance-rewrite of this system, the database->regen->thumbnails call is now removed</li>
					<li>all three fields of text on serialised pngs now wrap, and they pad a little better as well</li>
					<li>added a new option to the 'gui pages' options page to force input text box focus on page changes</li>
					<li>fixed a small type issue with the server's session cookie code and some new library versions</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 348</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote some OR search help to 'getting started with tags' help page</li>
					<li>wrote a new multi-reader, single-writer lock object for the client file manager, along with some unit tests for it.</li>
					<li>updated the file and thumbnail access and regen and maintenance code to use the new lock. various access is now faster when available and overall safer. there is still work to do here</li>
					<li>adjusted file import to be less aggressive about locking, which should reduce some file/thumbnail access lag during heavy imports</li>
					<li>the thumbnail space estimate in the migrate database dialog is now more adaptive to the new more flexible thumbnail size system and specificies better that it is an estimate</li>
					<li>the client api's /add_tags/add_tags call now collapses siblings and expands parents on an add/pend call. this can be turned off by setting the new optional parameter 'add_siblings_and_parents' to false. the help is updated regarding this and the client api version is incremented to 6</li>
					<li>fixed the client api's /add_tags/add_tags call for the 'hashes' parameter, which was failing to parse, and added an accidentally missing unit test to check this in future</li>
					<li>the client local services (the booru and client api) now have two new options under their 'manage services' panel: 'support CORS', which turns on cross-orogin support (which is experimental for now, so defaults to False), and 'logs requests', which controls whether your log will be spammed with request reports (this also defaults to False), which should clear up some 100MB+ log hassle for people using the Hydrus Companion browser add-on</li>
					<li>hydrus services now respond correctly (albeit sparsely) to OPTIONS requests, and if CORS is enabled, to CORS OPTIONS requests. there are unit tests for this that seem to work ok, but I think we'll need to verify it irl</li>
					<li>finished a first version bitmap manager to handle all wx bitmap creation and destruction, including recycling mid-steps</li>
					<li>updated all simple wx bitmap creation and destruction calls across the client to use the new bitmap manager, improving stability and saving some CPU</li>
					<li>fixed some incorrect button alignment flags that were causing problems for clients set to assert check these values</li>
					<li>added a new yiff.party file url class to the defaults that matches a new file attachment format</li>
					<li>updated the 'url' content parser so if a parsed url is in the form 'summary_text url', as some booru source fields sometimes specify, the preceding summary text is removed, cleaning up the resultant url</li>
					<li>silenced an old server connection lost error that was needlessly loud</li>
					<li>silenced the client network engine from additionally log-printing SizeException errors when a downloading file (usually gif) exceeds file import options rules</li>
					<li>improved misc window destruction code</li>
					<li>updated supported mime list in 'getting started with files' help and website index</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 347</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>or search:</li>
					<li>under construction OR predicates now present at the top of the regular tag results list, prepended with 'OR: ', and skipping default selection</li>
					<li>this new OR line is enter-able, which will present it as-is, rather than adding new preds</li>
					<li>hitting escape on a 'search' tag input box that is empty but has an under construction or predicate will cancel the or pred</li>
					<li>hitting escape on a 'search' tag input box otherwise should more reliably kill its focus when the dropdown is a float window</li>
					<li>improved OR search efficiency significantly with dynamic OR search triggering based on other search predicates. OR searches including negated '-tag' components should be massively faster when paired with non-OR tag or file search predicates</li>
					<li>I believe I fixed a search issue that would sometimes return insufficient results when OR preds are mixed with certain other combinations of tags</li>
					<li>improved reliability of some thumbnail refresh calls</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of OR handling ui code</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>after previous weeks' experiments, wrote new double-layer thumbnail loading system--now too-small thumbs will quckly scale up fuzzily straight to screen, and then in the coming seconds, the nice regenerated full-size thumb will be made and drawn in place as ready. it presents much faster and looks better, but there is some cleanup to do here that I will tackle next week</li>
					<li>all local file trashing events now record a context-appropriate deletion statement such as "Deleted from Media Viewer." this value is recovered in 'deleted' import status 'notes'. You will mostly see 'Unknown deletion reason.', for files deleted before this new system, but it will populate with appropriate info over time</li>
					<li>fixed a search optimisation that was not cross-referencing with file domain, meaning for instance that bare system:rating calls were returning since-deleted files</li>
					<li>upnp management window now uses new listctrl</li>
					<li>cleaned up some old custom page-naming code</li>
					<li>added a 'data' debug call to clear out all cached thumbnails and force an instant ui thumb reload</li>
					<li>fixed the trash bmp misalignment, ha ha</li>
					<li>removed e-hentai login script from the defaults, since this testing script is not appropriate for new users</li>
					<li>dejanked some media viewer video transitions by cleaning up animation bar rendering and smoothing out video buffer initialisation</li>
					<li>cleaned out some surplus subprocess wait calls that were hanging some systems on various 'open externally' calls</li>
					<li>fixed multiple syncing problems with 'synchronise' export folders that produce files with subdirectories. subdirectory structures should now be synced correctly and empty folders deleted</li>
					<li>export folders that collapse multiple file results to the same duplicated name should, after the next run, do less overwriting to this same name</li>
					<li>if an export folder or the regular export dialog makes a file destination path that is above the chosen directory (e.g. if the path starts with ../ or ..\), the export job will error out with an explanation</li>
					<li>big manual file exports _should_ be politer to the ui and cause fewer hangs</li>
					<li>doing page tab drag and drops may have less post-drop ui jank on linux, continued feedback would be appreciated</li>
					<li>moved 'reason' handling for all content updates to its own area, which neatens many content update data handling issues</li>
					<li>fixed petitioning a tag via a shortcut, which had bad reason handling</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with committing pending ipfs items that was overchecking service permissions</li>
					<li>fixed some remaining bad wx code in the unit tests</li>
					<li>misc file status reporting cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 346</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>or search:</li>
					<li>extended the search predicate object to handle more OR stuff</li>
					<li>extended the tag list to handle list objects that have multiple colours</li>
					<li>extended the new OR search predicate to report multiple text-snippet-and-colour pairs based on sub-predicates</li>
					<li>extended tag search input to handle prototype OR predicate creation--hold shift when you enter the tag, and it'll start an OR chain. shift-enter continues the chain, enter alone completes it</li>
					<li>fleshed out the predicate unit tests to cover more of this</li>
					<li>wrote unit tests for OR search predicates. it seems good!</li>
					<li>improved some search logic to apply system preds better in certain edge cases and spend less CPU on OR-search-only searches</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>thumbnails:</li>
					<li>thumbnails will now queue for load in a more intelligent order based on estimated difficulty to regenerate, which will tend to put more thumbs on screen faster</li>
					<li>the decision to regenerate a thumbnail from source is now tempered by how different the current thumbnail is from what is desired--the more similar the two sizes, the more (randomly) likely the client will decide to just use the current (resized) this time. this smooths out change-lag while limiting the number of really fuzzy thumbs you get. feedback on how this works IRL would be appreciated--it uses some voodoo distribution polling to figure it out, which I can definitely tweak</li>
					<li>improved visual quality of thumbnail scale-up optimisations</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where a multipage thumbnail grid would incorrectly recalculate the new virtual height after a thumbnail size change event, leading to a bit of invalid extra scrollspace (with noclip rendering errors) at the bottom</li>
					<li>the thumbnail right-click menu's reparse files entry is now extended to a new 'regenerate' submenu with three options: reparse file and regen thumbs (the old action), force regen thumbs, and regen thumbs if wrong size!</li>
					<li>the new 'regen if thumbs wrong size' action sends how many thumbs needed resize up to the popup window, as well</li>
					<li>moved some old thumbnail regen code responsibility out of the db and into the files manager</li>
					<li>cleaned out some old redundant file/thumbnail code</li>
					<li>cleaned and refactored a bunch of general image handling and resizing code</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>fixed some bad serialisation code that was making file search objects set their 'include current tags' value to false/true on interleaving loads. on this update, all 'include current tags' values are blanket reset to true</li>
					<li>fixed an issue that was drawing animation canvases pure white on various media update events</li>
					<li>extended manage urls dialog to support multiple files when launched from a selection of thumbnails. there is a warning in this case, noting that only gallery-style urls are appropriate to be added to multiple files</li>
					<li>manage urls dialog now supports multiple selections, including shift-select, and accepts delete key presses for easy mass deletion</li>
					<li>when you ask the database migration dialog to move some files, it now pops up a confirmation dialog that also asks if you would like to limit the max time for the job as 10, 30, or 60 minutes</li>
					<li>improved file permission setting code across the program to be more sensible for non-Windows</li>
					<li>if you are a non-Windows user and were hit with directory permission problems last week on the thumbnail update--which resulted in the rxx directories not being deleted--the update this week will attempt to do the delete again, this time correcting the now missing execute permission bit. if it finds outstanding rxx directories to delete, it will give a popup beforehand summarising the situation and giving you a chance to bail out</li>
					<li>fixed yet another problem that was stopping client api url requests from finding the correct page by name</li>
					<li>when a client api url request includes fixed tags, these tags should now propagate in all scenarios where the single url produces multiple files</li>
					<li>updated sqlite dll and console for windows</li>
					<li>misc fixes and cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 345</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>or search:</li>
					<li>set out a plan to achieve some simple conjunctive normal form (e.g. (blue eyes OR green eyes) AND (blonde hair OR red hair)) OR search support</li>
					<li>started work on the object extension and search code to support this search in a very basic (and likely inefficient-for-some-scenarios) way--we'll work on this as we discover the most common inefficiencies</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>thumbnails:</li>
					<li>the client no longer uses both 'master' and 'resized' thumbnails--it uses a single, smarter thumbnail</li>
					<li>only the 'txx' thumbnail directories (formerly referred to as full-size) are now used, and the thumbnails inside will regenerate and scale themselves as needed on demand (and will be careful to not save changes to disk when when their source file is non-local)</li>
					<li>the old 'rxx' 'resized' thumbnail directories are no longer referred to anywhere in the code or ui</li>
					<li>the old 'rxx' thumbnails directories will be permanently (i.e. no recycle bin) deleted on update. this is a big job, and you will be prompted on update before it happens</li>
					<li>if you have migrated your db to put 'resized' thumbs on an SSD but not the formerly 'full-size', you will want to recheck the 'migrate database' dialog once you have booted and set a new thumbnail override to move the txx directories over</li>
					<li>due to the smarter thumbnail, 200x200 is no longer the hard limit for hydrus thumbnails! you can now set up to 2048x2048</li>
					<li>all file storage location information is now stored directly in the client db (rather than the options object), which should make for more easily export/importable options in future and improve manual fixing as needed</li>
					<li>added more thumbnail-resizing related popup spam to file report mode</li>
					<li>fixed a windows-only issue that was making the migrate db dialog close after a file move event concluded</li>
					<li>updated database migration help for new concepts and ui</li>
					<li>cleaned up some misc storage code</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>fixed a problem in the client api with fetching file identifiers from file_ids</li>
					<li>fleshed out 'help my db is broke.txt' with more specific clone recovery examples</li>
					<li>fixed import support for a variety of single-frame music webms</li>
					<li>fixed an edge-case preview viewer initialisation bug that was trying to draw the canvas before any media was set</li>
					<li>network report mode now states url classes of urls about to be parsed</li>
					<li>misc small fixes and cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 344</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>final v1.0 client api polish:</li>
					<li>added optional 'show_destination_page' arg to '/add_urls/add_url', defaulting to False, to control whether an URL-add will select (i.e. jump to) the destination page in the ui. this changes the default behaviour for this command</li>
					<li>simplified the routine that finds or creates a watcher or url import page and fixed a bug in the api that was not creating new pages when destination_page_name was specified</li>
					<li>some misc cleanup</li>
					<li>fixed fetching file_metadata by hashes</li>
					<li>fixed the client api help regarding file_metadata response example tags</li>
					<li>client api version is now 5</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>psd support added! because of this format's potential multi-layer complexity, it will not render natively, but width and height are parsed. it is treated as 'application/x-photoshop'. PSB is also recognised and treated as psd</li>
					<li>added a 'open_known_url' shortcut to the 'media' shortcut set that lets you quickly open URLs for files. if there is one recognised known url, it will be launched, and if there are multiple, a list with all known urls will appear to select which one you want</li>
					<li>animation scanbars now show an x/y current timestamp! it includes millisecond timings and even works for variable framerate gifs. whether to show a second/shadow caret for timestamp position on variable frame rate is a new discussion to have</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where animations would sometimes not resume animation for several seconds after a big scanbar drag</li>
					<li>when the thumbnail manager cannot produce a thumbnail due to a storage error (like a missing file), it now only puts up a single, more informative error popup on the first problem. subsequent errors are printed silently to the log. (these errors tend to come in en masse, so this cuts down on spam and error-related ui lag that was making loading a bad session difficult)</li>
					<li>improved error reporting when an upload pending command would fail due to service non-functionality--it should now give a popup with error info imediately, rather than obscured through the login system</li>
					<li>added temp_dir parameter to the client and server that will override which temporary directory the program will use</li>
					<li>cleaned up how no_daemons and no_wal mode are handled internally</li>
					<li>no_wal mode now has to be called from the command parameter, the no_wal file hack in the db directory no longer works</li>
					<li>missing ffmpeg errors now prompt the user to check if it is installed</li>
					<li>searching for numerical ratings should now work for files that were rated when the service had a different number of stars (ratings now searches in 'bands' rather than exact values)</li>
					<li>reduced the min height of the new import files frame's list</li>
					<li>doubled the decompression bomb test to permit files up to ~179 megapixel, we'll see how it goes</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 343</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>client api:</li>
					<li>fixed an int/str type mismatch issue with service_names_to_actions_to_tags in /add_tags/add_tags in the client api that meant that argument was not working</li>
					<li>fixed up some last /get_files/search_files stuff</li>
					<li>added /get_files/file_metadata</li>
					<li>added /get_files/file</li>
					<li>added /get_files/thumbnail</li>
					<li>added help and unit tests to reflect the above</li>
					<li>updated client api version to 4</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>the list of paths in the manual file import dialog is now sortable. this order will be preserved in regular and 'add tags' ok events for this dialog. it has a new '#' column so you can return to 'parse' order if desired</li>
					<li>animation and static image windows in the media viewer canvas are now recycled through media type transitions, making for slightly smoother browsing between mixed media</li>
					<li>increased aggression of media viewer image prefetch</li>
					<li>added support for 'MM' Tiffs</li>
					<li>fixed webm mime parsing for webms with no audio (these were falling back to mkv)</li>
					<li>improved the error reports when a serialised png fails to import</li>
					<li>the mass-open-urls popup is now pausable as well as cancellable</li>
					<li>fixed several recently broken ui unit tests</li>
					<li>misc old code cleanup</li>
					<li>some misc test controller/constant refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 342</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added support for webp import. it does not yet support animated webps, which, if the local platform supports, will import like apngs used to: just the first frame</li>
					<li>added support for tiff import. it works ok for 24bit and 8bit (monochrome) tiffs, but I am not sure how well it will do with 48bit</li>
					<li>both webp and tiff should work on the duplicate files system</li>
					<li>improved webm detection to include opus audio (previously, these files were falling back to mkv)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where unusual formats with duration but no frames or frames but no duration were being sorted and otherwise presented incorrectly</li>
					<li>improved autocomplete job cancelability. this job can now cancel much faster on large jobs, meaning typing searches with large result sets will hit less CPU and return faster on subsequent keystrokes</li>
					<li>_all_ of the complicated 'copy url' commands from the thumbnail right-click->known urls menu are now available on the 'open' submenu! if there is more than one url to open (e.g. 'open all of these files blahbooru post urls' on a selection of 50 files), you will be presented with a yes/no dialog to confirm, and it will open one url in your browser every second (with a cancellable popup if num_urls > 5)</li>
					<li>by default, system:everything is now hidden if its total files is >10k. you can force it to always show under options->default system predicates</li>
					<li>the gallery downloader's list's status column now shows gallery status (deferring to active file status) when appropriate and shows 'done!' when all work is complete</li>
					<li>after working back and forth with a user, I _believe_ the linux similar files >0 distance search crash is finally fixed</li>
					<li>fixed sorting by media views/viewtiming with collections</li>
					<li>a single-selected collection right-click now shows total media views for all files in the collection! you can now see how long you have been viewing an artist!</li>
					<li>fixed an issue that lead to export folders not running on always-on clients as often as they should</li>
					<li>updated the gelbooru 0.2.5 file page parser to pull rating tag from the correct location (previously, it was pulling from what appears to be a site-wide 'mature' browser hint)</li>
					<li>improved memory cleanup stability when animations and other parts of the video rendering pipeline are deleted--this _may_ fix some rare crashes</li>
					<li>increased animation rendering aggression overall and particularly in 'future' of frame buffer</li>
					<li>if a video renderer that is asked to start some way into the video fails to render anything, it will now fall back to trying to render from the beginning. this is slightly hacky atm and leads to out of phase rendering frames, but it is better than an error</li>
					<li>added a '--no_db_temp_files' launch parameter that will force the client or server to return to the recent old behaviour of exclusively using memory for journalling. this is useful if your temp directory is small and/or your available ram is very large. if running in this mode, the client will attempt to check available memory (instead of free space on your temp dir) before performing very large transactions</li>
					<li>with the new lighter-weight update transactions, the client now tests for less free space for journalling before running repository update processing</li>
					<li>added /get_files/search_files to the client api, which does the first half of file searching. it allows tag search (including -tag negation) and system inbox/archive. since the second half, which will fetch file metadata, is not yet in, this can't do anything interesting yet</li>
					<li>updated help and unit tests to support this, client api version is now 3</li>
					<li>some misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 341</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>client api:</li>
					<li>added /add_tags/add_tags, which does several kinds of tag content updates</li>
					<li>added /add_tags/clean_tags, which shows how hydrus will handle potential tags</li>
					<li>added /add_urls/associate_url, which allows you to associate urls with files</li>
					<li>added 'destination_page_name' to /add_urls/add_url, which will choose which destination watcher/url importer to place the url (or create a new one with that name)</li>
					<li>updated client api version to 2</li>
					<li>updated client help and unit tests for the above</li>
					<li>added a linked contents to the client api help</li>
					<li>improved some server error handling, mostly moving 403s to more correct 400s</li>
					<li>improved how missing parameter 400 errors are reported from the server vs deeper keyerrors that should be 500</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>tag repository update processing now saves progress to disk every million rows or every minute, whichever comes first. this reduces journaling bloat, improves recovery when the process quits unexpectedly, and makes for significantly faster cancel when requested by the user</li>
					<li>when processing duplicates and copying/merging/moving ratings, the 'source' file will now also overwrite the 'destination' file's rating if that destination rating is lower (previously, the rating would only go over if the dest had no rating set)</li>
					<li>added a new 'thumbnail experiment mode' under help->debug->gui. this will load fullsize thumbs and resize them in memory, please see release post for more details</li>
					<li>reduced menubar replacement flicker while, I believe, keeping and strengthening recent menubar indexing stability improvements</li>
					<li>the tag autocomplete dropdown will now always embed (instead of floating) in non-Windows</li>
					<li>when data seems non-decodable, the fallback encoding format is now that given by chardet, rather than utf-8</li>
					<li>improved serialisability of some pending tag data</li>
					<li>watchers can now hold and pass on fixed pending tag data</li>
					<li>gallery log objects can now hold and pass on fixed pending tag data</li>
					<li>file import objects can now hold and action fixed pending tag data</li>
					<li>hard drive imports now store their paths-to-tags info in this new format, directly in the file import objects</li>
					<li>improved some url-import page drop-target-selection logic</li>
					<li>improved error reporting when dropping/api-adding urls</li>
					<li>adjusted some url import workflow so big 'already in db' download lists should work a bit faster</li>
					<li>attempting to start the program with some external database files but not the main 'client.db/server.db' file will now cause a boot-fail exception with an explanation before any stub db files can be made</li>
					<li>tightened up some hydrus service login-capability-testing code that was previously stopping certain error states from recovering promptly, even on a force account refresh, while the service was maxed on bandwidth</li>
					<li>fixed a source of linux CRITICAL logspam related to several common dialogs</li>
					<li>improved ui stability on boot when file folders are missing (particularly for linux)</li>
					<li>improved stability for the various async tasks on the duplicates processing page, particularly for linux. I am not sure I got everything here, but it is definitely better</li>
					<li>did some more misc stability improvements, particularly in various boot fail scenarios</li>
					<li>completely removed an ancient and janky focus catcher widget from the main gui frame</li>
					<li>now various db caching is improved on the python side, removed a sqlite instruction to force temp information to always stay in memory--hot data returns to staying mostly in memory to start and then spools to disk if the transaction gets too large</li>
					<li>fixed approx bitrate sorting for malformed video files with explicitly '0' duration</li>
					<li>daemon_profile_mode now spams some more info about export folders</li>
					<li>fixed an issue that meant client db maintenance was firing its jobs too aggressively, regardless of idle status</li>
					<li>updated windows build to cv 4.0</li>
					<li>misc refactoring and fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 340</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>client api:</li>
					<li>fixed up some api permissions object stuff so that /verify_access_key response can always serialise correctly</li>
					<li>fixed the 'add_url' api call's instability</li>
					<li>the API will now always return JSON on 200. anything else should be presumed to be raw text</li>
					<li>'/api_version' now returns JSON, and after talking with users, it will now start incrementing with every api change. it remains 1 just for this week</li>
					<li>'/request_access_permissions' now returns JSON</li>
					<li>'/add_url' now results JSON on success with more info, 403 on failure</li>
					<li>'/get_url_info' now returns the 'normalised_url' in the response JSON</li>
					<li>added '/get_url_files', which returns 'url_file_statuses', listing known hashes and file import status for that url</li>
					<li>added '/add_files/add_file', which can import a file from a path or bytes</li>
					<li>added '/add_tags/get_tag_services', which will return info on the client's tag services</li>
					<li>updated client api help to reflect the above changes and fleshed out the intro a bit</li>
					<li>fixed the client api permissions enum values in the help, which I somehow transcribed wrong first time</li>
					<li>updated the client api tests to check the above</li>
					<li>refactored client api tests to be neater and in their own file</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>the rest:</li>
					<li>fixed the page of pages close bug</li>
					<li>added a downloader for nijie.info to the client defaults (it needs a login)</li>
					<li>updated danbooru file page parsers to get 'rating' tag</li>
					<li>added gelbooru 0.1.11 parser for future application</li>
					<li>fixed an issue that was stopping advanced content updates from fully copying all the desired mappings in the transaction</li>
					<li>added a semi-hacky checkbox to 'options->files and trash' that will delay all new file/thumb requests for 15s after the computer resumes from sleep (useful if your files are on a NAS that takes a few seconds to reconnect on wake)</li>
					<li>wrote some more graceful fallback decoding handling code that attempts original assumed encoding and 'utf-8' if different and returns the one with the fewest '�' replacement characters</li>
					<li>the network engine and the ffmpeg info parsing now use this new 'safe' decoding, so even if a site has borked bytes or the video file has unexpected Shift-JIS title metadata, it'll still go through, albeit with some question marks</li>
					<li>moved some more old daemons to the new job scheduler, deleted some old daemon code</li>
					<li>improved some daemon job wake and shutdown code</li>
					<li>wrote a proper upnp manager object and improved all-around reliability of the auto upnp-service-mapping code</li>
					<li>simplified the upnp check code so it now only ever checks/does anything if the respective services actually want upnp mappings. surplus mappings are now wiped immediately on service update</li>
					<li>fixed upnp mapping fetching to cope with ipv6 results</li>
					<li>improved some memory clearing code to deal with some semi-stubborn objects</li>
					<li>improved some 'iterate through this giant list of single numbers from the db without using a lot of memory' code and applied it to the autocomplete cache regeneration routine</li>
					<li>improved menubar stability, both in finding menus and swapping them out</li>
					<li>if a serialised json object fails to load from the db, this is now caught, the bad object deleted and written to a new file in the db dir, and all logging info captured along with an explanatory popup thrown on screen. so, if a subscription fails to load, it will now be extracted so that a subsequent subscription edit/run will work with the remaining good objects. in the case of backed-up objects (gui sessions atm), reattempting the load should restore the next most recent backup</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with login script validation when the given credentials have surplus ( key, value ) pairs to the script's credential definitions</li>
					<li>fixed two login invalid cookie error handling bugs</li>
					<li>maybe made some dupe filter searching more stable</li>
					<li>fixed a py2 datatype issue that made the client unbootable when updating the client from <296</li>
					<li>the client now pauses to nag and moan about backups if you try to update more than 15 versions in one go</li>
					<li>slightly sped up discord bugfix file drag and drops and expanded file limit up to 25 files/200MB</li>
					<li>added experimental secret discord bugfix dnd mode checkbox</li>
					<li>improved how html parsing deals with some unexpected bad tag data</li>
					<li>turned on primitive high-dpi support for OS X. let me know if it fixes any blurry issues on retina displays</li>
					<li>wrote a new 'ui test' under the debug->gui menu to help catch common-action bugs that slipped through weekly work</li>
					<li>improved how the test code does some wx/ui stuff, but also broke some more and ran out of time to clean it up--this is an ongoing project</li>
					<li>improved how some text import line splitting works</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 339</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>client api:</li>
					<li>wrote some ui to handle client api permissions adding and editing</li>
					<li>wrote a 'catch a permissions request' mini-dialog for external api permissions adding</li>
					<li>wrote api calls:</li>
					<li>GET</li>
					<li>/api_version</li>
					<li>/request_new_permissions</li>
					<li>/verify_access_key</li>
					<li>/add_urls/get_url_info</li>
					<li>POST</li>
					<li>/add_urls/add_url</li>
					<li>and made a new 'client api' help page to describe in detail what these do</li>
					<li>wrote fairly comprehensive unit tests for the new client api</li>
					<li>refactored a bunch of 'hydrus network' specific stuff away from general server code that the client api now uses</li>
					<li>neatened up 401 vs 403 error handling across the program, and replaced some clientside error handling that was inelegantly borrowing these network errors</li>
					<li>deleted very old prototype file/thumbnail client server fetch code, which was no longer in use</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc and bug fixes:</li>
					<li>added a 'clear ratings' button to the ratings service 'review services' panels. it can clear out ratings for deleted, non-local, or _all_ files</li>
					<li>the '3 downloaders are working, is it ok to close the client?' message is now folded into the 'confirm client exit (auto-yes in 15s)' dialog. this merged dialog will still appear for users who have the regular confirm client exit dialog turned off (and still auto-yeses in 15s)</li>
					<li>the file url downloader now reports 'downloading file' and 'importing url' text status separately</li>
					<li>fixed a typo bug from last week that was breaking asc/desc ratings service sorting</li>
					<li>fixed a typo bug from last week that was stopping manage import folders from opening</li>
					<li>fixed a typo bug from last week that was breaking setting upnp port on the local booru/client api service management panel</li>
					<li>the advanced file reparse-and-re-thumbnailing routine now correctly moves a file to its new extension if its mime changes (e.g. png->apng, or webm/mkv distinctions)</li>
					<li>the client file manager now silently detects and auto-repairs instances of missing files where the file actually does exist, just with the wrong extension</li>
					<li>fixed a url parsing issue that was normalise-mangling url classes with no path but some query parameters</li>
					<li>the network engine now uses utf-8 decoding when no specific encoding is set (previously ISO-8859-1)</li>
					<li>fixed an ffmpeg video parsing bug when the video included Shift-JIS metadata. it should work for other unusual encodings as well</li>
					<li>maybe cleaned up some menubar management code</li>
					<li>the filename tagging dialog now uses a notebook for service choice, like the manage tags dialog, rather than the janky old listbook</li>
					<li>fixed a py2-to-3 issue with the admin-only 'is server currently busy' check while a backup is running</li>
					<li>improved some dialog button event handling. it may completely fix the 'trytoendmodal' issue some users run into</li>
					<li>improved some JSON db serialisation error reporting code, trying to pin down an issue several users have seen with session save</li>
					<li>improved thread-safety of serialisable objects as they serialise</li>
					<li>misc improvements and cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 338</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>after talking with some users, put a bit of time into tag autocomplete wolkflow. both read (search pages) and write (manage tags) autocomplete inputs now operate ~asynchronously~, with the tag fetch working on a separate thread. tag jobs can also now cancel at certain checkpoints in the tag search process if overwritten by a new request. therefore, a variety of tag lookup scenarios _should_ be less painful. this change was executed in a semi-inelegant way, so please report if you encounter bugs from fast typing etc...</li>
					<li>I also improved some of the "I hit enter before results were in" code as a result of this. not sure I have it totally nailed, so please give feedback on errors here</li>
					<li>wildcard search tags now have an explicit '(wildcard search)' after their label</li>
					<li>taglists that have an attached page of media (basically the 'selection tags' box and the 'active search predicates' up top) now have a right-click menu entry to 'select files with (all these tags)' and, if more than one tag is selected, 'select files with (any of these tags)'! This is pretty neat in action, so give it a go!</li>
					<li>added a 'sort by approx bitrate' file sorting option that does a basic filesize/duration so you can filter out dense gifs and other short-but-big vids a bit easier. anything without a duration is shoved to the 'smallest' side</li>
					<li>some of the file sort options now default to their respective 'biggest' first, see how you like it</li>
					<li>folded in updated gelbooru file page parser (fixing the 403 errors that just appeared) and added searches for gelbooru user favourites and pools</li>
					<li>if a gallery or watchable url ends up in the file processing queue (and hence fails), it now says the believed-to-be url class name in the error, which should help some false positive url class matching debugging</li>
					<li>fixed a focused-file selection issue that meant preview viewtime was frequently counting in file viewing statistics even while a page was not currently in view</li>
					<li>fixed the local booru review service panel, which wasn't fully deleting shares when the button was clicked</li>
					<li>wrote a service object and basic server skeleton for the client api (basically refactoring the existing local booru code). client api now appears in manage and review services and can boot and present the normal hydrus browser welcome page at '/'</li>
					<li>the client api and the local booru now have an 'allow non-local connections' checkbox! defaulting to off and on respectively</li>
					<li>updated a wx-thread call function to more safely and universally deal with instances where the responsible window died before the call could be made</li>
					<li>removed some old experimental crypto code that isn't used any more--pycryptodome is no longer needed to run the program from source</li>
					<li>improved some misc client service code</li>
					<li>deleted some old unused code</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
					<li>updated to ffmpeg 4.1 on windows release</li>
					<li>updated to sqlite 3.26 on windows release</li>
					<li>updated to wxpython 4.0.4 on all platforms</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 337</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed another couple of unicode encoding problems with the logging and profiling code</li>
					<li>the logger now sticks a unicode BOM at the top of new log files to help text readers guess the utf-8 encoding</li>
					<li>fixed musical webm import when the video stream has no stated duration but the audio stream does and typically stretches out a 'single frame' video</li>
					<li>fixed some 'max size' download file size testing</li>
					<li>'waiting on bandwidth' statements on network job controls now show the specific network context (like 'web domain: somesite.com') they are waiting on (you might need to hover over to see the tooltip for this)</li>
					<li>the downloader easy-importer lain image is now clickable to launch a file selection dialog</li>
					<li>if you are in advanced mode, the manual file export dialog now lets you export symlinks with a new checkbox. this is experimental, so if you are interested, give it a brief test and let me know how it works for you</li>
					<li>duplicate content merging now applies to pending as well as current tags</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now counts pending tags when saying which file has more tags</li>
					<li>advanced content updates now _copy_ both current and pending tags. the other actions now state what they do more clearly</li>
					<li>stopped printing long server error text on 304 and 404, where actual response content is uninteresting</li>
					<li>removed wx import that accidentally came into server space due to 2to3 check</li>
					<li>improved the path-fixing code that helps environment construction when launching external programs from non-windows frozen builds</li>
					<li>fixed a critical pubsub processing bug that kicked in at a certain stage of client shutdown. this should stop the post-shutdown-processing memory explosion certain users were seeing and should stop any ui jank in the last 0.2s of the program for everyone else</li>
					<li>improved some other shutdown memory cleanup that was sometimes leading to double-log-printing of exit statements</li>
					<li>did a full pass over the daemon scheduling code. it now reacts more responsively to various shut down situations</li>
					<li>reduced db disk cache aggression significantly and added more memory maintenance to the cache population process</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where subscriptions were not promptly responding to shutdown events</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where some delayed network jobs (e.g. while all network traffic is paused) were also not responding to shutdown events</li>
					<li>added a 'pubsub report mode' debug mode for simpler pubsub review</li>
					<li>the db is now less redundantly spammy on certain behind the scenes update notifications</li>
					<li>wrote a first version of the client api manager and permissions handling objects</li>
					<li>misc fixes, cleaned some shutdown code</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 336</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed an issue where the numerical rating control was coercing all clicks to either the minimum or maximum allowable rating (e.g. 3/5 stars wasn't working)</li>
					<li>fixed some text file and process i/o, which was handling some unicode decoding/encoding incorrectly. it now mandates utf-8 in all cases</li>
					<li>fixed a referral url encoding problem that was stopping pixiv from downloading when the gallery page url had kana/kanji characters (from a search term)</li>
					<li>fixed a str vs bytes issue when loading the filename tagging panel</li>
					<li>fixed the delete button on the filename tagging quick namespaces panel (the edit and delete buttons are also now 'live' and will disable when nothing is selected)</li>
					<li>improved some json dump deserialisation code</li>
					<li>fixed a data-sorting issue that would appear with certain parsers in the edit parsers panel</li>
					<li>improved video metadata parsing, fixing an issue when the video has a 'title' row containing inconvenient data</li>
					<li>fixed some hex character processing for system preds</li>
					<li>added an advanced check item to the gallery downloader cog icon menu that will 'bundle' multiple query-pastes to the same single gallery downloader (this is helpful if you are pasting a whole bunch of md5 queries in one go and would rather one downloader work through them sequentially than 50+ separate ones blat your CPU simultaneously)</li>
					<li>the different kinds of importer worker threads now have several limits on the max number that can be working at once, to stop accidental ui overload when a hundred or more are in memory and all want to work at once (like after a big paste event or resuming after computer sleep). during periods of heavy import activity, the importers will now naturally space themselves out to smooth out the spike. the limits are hardcoded for now, let me know if it noticeably bottlenecks your situation</li>
					<li>made some menubar update code a bit less complicated and reduced how often it'll spam during heavy update</li>
					<li>the 'what to do?' buttons that appear in manage tags sometimes on a tag action got a simplification pass and are now on the new dialog system</li>
					<li>simplified my new dialog code significantly, clearing out redundant code and classes and pushing all okable/cancellable/vetoable closing checks through one single method</li>
					<li>wrote some new help.txt in the db dir about hanging startups</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 335</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li class="dealwithit">important:</li>
					<li>hydrus now runs completely and exclusively on python 3!</li>
					<li>for users who are updating, the client has special install instructions for just this week:</li>
					<li>if you are a windows or linux user who extracts to install, you will have to delete your old install's files (but keep your db folder!!!) before installing/extracting the new version so there are no 2/3 dll/so conflicts (don't delete your db folder!)</li>
					<li>if you use the windows installer to install, this v335 installer will do the clean install for you! there is absolutely no way this could go wrong, so no need to make a backup beforehand :^)</li>
					<li>if you are an os x user, I am now only releasing the client in the app. furthermore, the default app db location is now ~/Library/Hydrus (i.e. /Users/[you]/Library/Hydrus). you will have to move your existing db to this location to update, and thereafter you'll just be replacing the app in Applications!</li>
					<li>if you try to boot a non-clean mixed 2/3 install, the client will try to recognise that and give an error and dump out</li>
					<li>please check the release post for more detailed instructions here</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>semi-important:</li>
					<li>the db password feature may be one-time broken for unusual keyboard languages, so failures this version will be forgiven with an appropriate error message explaining the situation. feedback from ???? ????? lads appreciated</li>
					<li>I may have fixed the issue some linux/os x users were having launching external programs, including OS ffmpeg (it was a child process environment issue related to pyinstaller)</li>
					<li>although I did most of my devving here on py 3.6, the client seems to run ok on 3.5. I doubt 3.4 will do it, if you mean to run from source</li>
					<li>I moved from the old pycrypto to the new pycryptodome, so users who run from source will want to get this. I also dropped some libraries</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc bug fixes:</li>
					<li>fixed the 'load one of the default options' button on manage tag import options when a set of default options is orphaned by a deleted url class</li>
					<li>removed some popup flicker related to long error messages</li>
					<li>fixed some parsing testing ui error handling</li>
					<li>cleared up some bad text ctrl event handling that could sometimes cause a recursive loop</li>
					<li>listctrls should now sort text that includes numbers in the human-friendly 2 < 10 fashion</li>
					<li>cleaned up some bad external process calling code and improved how child process environment is set up</li>
					<li>finally figured out the basic problem of a long-time nested dialog event handling error that could sometimes freeze the ui. I may have fixed it in one case and will keep working on this</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>boring details:</li>
					<li>ran 2to3 to auto-convert what could be done</li>
					<li>updated environment to python 3</li>
					<li>went over a whole ton of unicode encoding/decoding manually to update it to python 3</li>
					<li>removed all the old tobytestring/tounicode calls in favour of new python 3 handling</li>
					<li>fixed all the file io to do bytes/str as appropriate</li>
					<li>corrected a bunch of / vs // int/float stuff</li>
					<li>fixed up twisted, which has some str/bytes stuff going on</li>
					<li>fixed all the listctrls to deal with column sorting None values amongst ints/strs</li>
					<li>fixed png export/import, which had some fun bytes/bytearray/int/str issues</li>
					<li>updated the swf header parsing code to py3 (more str/bytes stuff)</li>
					<li>misc float/int fixes</li>
					<li>fixed up some http.cookies handling, which has changed in py3</li>
					<li>improved some ancient loopback connection code that was only really checking to see if ports were in use</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of now-invalid parameter tuples that 2to3 helpfully marked</li>
					<li>numerous misc other refactoring and so on</li>
					<li>updated the new network engine to now decode non-utf-8 responses correctly based on actual response header</li>
					<li>removed some old py2 manual http multipart code</li>
					<li>removed the old py2 'matroska or webm' parsing py, replacing it with some direct ffmpeg format inspection</li>
					<li>replaced all % formatting with the new .format system. I will slowly move to this rather than the current endless concatenation mess</li>
					<li>deleted some more misc old code</li>
					<li>tightened up some spammy network error reporting</li>
					<li>converted all /r/n to /n in my environment project, ha ha ha</li>
					<li>the ui seems to better support rarer unicode characters like ??</li>
					<li>updated some of the install/update/backup help for all this, and some misc other stuff as well</li>
					<li>fixed misc bugs</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 334</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote a system:file viewing stats to comprehensively search the new viewing stats--it _should_ also be synced with the exact current values</li>
					<li>but for system:everything, inbox, and archive, which remain where they were, system predicates are now sorted alphabetically!</li>
					<li>added a _database->file viewing stats_ menu that lets you suspend file view tracking and clear all records permanently</li>
					<li>mr. bones now welcomes all users under the help menu</li>
					<li>fixed mr. bones's confusion at those who have yet to board the ride</li>
					<li>also mr. bones now makes sure to get the latest file viewing stats</li>
					<li>moved confirm trash/archive from _options->gui_ to _options->files and trash_</li>
					<li>moved a bunch of 'pages' related stuff from _options->gui_ to the new _options->gui pages_</li>
					<li>added an option to options->gui pages to change the number of session rolling backups</li>
					<li>subscription popups now provide an x/y query progress string in their popup text</li>
					<li>the edit subs/sub panels are now a bit shorter by default and the edit sub has its own frame position data, under 'edit_subscription_dialog', and remembers its last size and position by default</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where some dupe watcher urls (like url and url#12345) were not being correctly merged on a mouse drag and drop watcher-import</li>
					<li>the client will now print up to 512KB of server error info to the log (previously 4KB)</li>
					<li>removed the youtube download prototype--if it returns, we'll do a proper youtube-dl solution. as a result, pafy is no longer needed to run the client</li>
					<li>network report mode now shows more network error information</li>
					<li>gave the 'getting started with subscriptions' help page a complete pass. it now reflects the new system and has up-to-date advice based on my new experience</li>
					<li>wrote a 'logins' section to the bottom of the 'getting started with downloading' help page</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 333</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added a first version of file viewing statistics! the client db now keeps track of how many times a file is loaded in the preview and full media viewers, and for how long!</li>
					<li>you can see the media and preview stats on any single media right-click menu. there are multiple options for how this displays, including hiding it completely, under options->media</li>
					<li>viewing stats update as they happen! (although viewtime typically only updates on the end of viewing. I'll likely make this more live, especially if I end up showing this info in the media media viewer)</li>
					<li>you can now sort files by total media views/viewtime!</li>
					<li>mr. bones's wild ride continues, as well</li>
					<li>deleted the old 'file list' way of updating in-ui media objects in favour of a long-planned global media cache. there is now only ever one active copy of any particular media, and all data-level updates need only occur once on that single copy. this saves a bunch of CPU, memory, and overall hassle behind the scenes! various search results/lookups for media already loaded elsewhere now load super fast!</li>
					<li>tag siblings refresh is quicker and less memory heavy thanks to this as well</li>
					<li>furthermore, the complicated tag changes from tag repository processing and advanced content updates are now reflected immediately in the gui on the job's completion! (as long as you have fewer than 10k files open, ha ha) previously, these required a search refresh to show the results</li>
					<li>the file sort choice dropdown on all pages is now sorted alphabetically. it has always been a mess picking what you want from here, so let's see if this helps!</li>
					<li>tag and rating sort options are now listed as 'tag:' and 'rating:' respectively</li>
					<li>fixed some misc file sort choice code, which was failing to keep certain defaults in certain situations</li>
					<li>fixed the tag import options' new 'load from defaults' button to correctly load the tag blacklist</li>
					<li>the keyboard icon on the media viewer's top hover window now permits activation of current/default shortcut sets under submenus. it now also omits these entries if no custom shortcut sets exist</li>
					<li>cleaned up some of the hover_window-canvas interaction code</li>
					<li>fixed some long-time sperg-out  buffer-drawing when changing position in a long video</li>
					<li>the database->backup actions are now hidden if the current db has non-default file/thumbnail locations. for now, in these cases, only a custom backup is appropriate</li>
					<li>fixed some ancient repository admin code that fetches summary account info given an account key</li>
					<li>the filename tagging dialog now has a much shorter listctrl by default, so should fit better on smaller monitors</li>
					<li>fixed the 'review session cookies' dialog's clear button, which was not deleting sessions after clear. it now also wraps the operation in a yes/no confirmation</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 332</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the client serialisation system now supports multiple rolling backups!</li>
					<li>client sessions (like the 'last session' that typically loads on boot) are now automatically backed up to ten times in rolling backups! you can review and append the backups if you need to recover from _pages->sessions->append session backup_, where they are listed by their timestamp!</li>
					<li>when the client closes, an additional 'exit session' is now saved. this differs to 'last session', which is overwritten every x minutes, and is now available (especially with the new backup) for various error recovery situations</li>
					<li>gallery import pages now have a little cog icon to control if new import queues will start with files and/or galleries paused. these states persist through a session reload</li>
					<li>tag import options that are 'defaultable' now have a button to let you load in a specific default, so you can easily quickly edit in a one-time slight alteration of the default rather than having to create everything from scratch</li>
					<li>under options->downloading, you can now set the 'delay' times on gallery/watcher network error, subscription network error, and subscription other error, now defaulting to 90mins, 12hours, and 36 hours respectively</li>
					<li>attempting to launch a client with db version > software version now spawns a blocking messagebox on pre-launch informing the user of the risks and advising task manager force-kill of the process</li>
					<li>did a little cleanup on the new tag id database cache and merged some other, older semi-laggy tag-fetching code to use the same system</li>
					<li>wrote a similar 'file id' database cache for caching file hashes and also merged some old hash-fetching code into it. a variety of file operations are now significantly faster</li>
					<li>export folders can now delete files from the client after export. the edit panel will warn you on selecting this and oking the panel. it can't be set if the export type is 'synchronise'.</li>
					<li>fixed the edit export folders dialog's old buttons, which were semi-working due to some recent update work</li>
					<li>when checking for file integrity, you can now choose to export a .txt file listing all the missing files' known urls, so you can try to recover by feeding them all back into a new url downloader!</li>
					<li>the physical file deletion process is now a little simpler and deals with larger jobs in smaller batches, no longer hogging the file read lock the whole time. clearing a large trash should no longer hang other media loads</li>
					<li>adding ngugs in the 'export downloaders' dialog now attempts to add the respective gugs as well</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the listctrl would accept certain kinds of duplicate data and hence confuse its indices</li>
					<li>fixed all the add buttons on the export downloader panel to exclude all items already in the list when figuring out what additional objects to add</li>
					<li>the 'scroll thumbs at this rate per tick' option now _rounds_ the pixel result, rather than always _floor_ing it</li>
					<li>wrote a new mass-selection database routine that should reduce memory footprint of autocomplete regeneration. if it works out, I will use it in some other places</li>
					<li>improved the errors when a network job that cannot wait fails on an invalid login, and added a separate error when it refers to a hydrus service</li>
					<li>fixed a small typo bug when trying to auto-add url classes and parsers</li>
					<li>updated an old deprecated checkboxlist call</li>
					<li>clarified the integrity section of 'help my db is broke.txt'</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 331</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added a 'do login now' button to the manage logins dialog. it only enables when the selected logins are active and not invalid and so on, and will ok the dialog and queue up some login attempts, which will make report popups as normal</li>
					<li>'review session cookies' panels now support drag and drop cookies.txt import! cookies.txt importing will also handle errors a bit better and report total number of added cookies</li>
					<li>the 'review session cookies' panel now defaults to not showing sessions with zero cookies. a new checkbox controls this</li>
					<li>login scripts can now be rolled into easy import pngs! should work for export and import just like the other objects (although they won't be auto-added based on domain in export dialog)</li>
					<li>brushed up some of the 'change login script' code--particularly, it now puts login scripts that have matching domains first in the selection list, for easier selection</li>
					<li>after striking a reckless bargain with a daemon from the database-plane, system:num_tags now runs significantly faster and produces accurate tag counts even when searching over multiple tag services that have duplicate tags. if this works out, the immaterial beast promises greater gains for similar jobs with no possibility of anything going wrong</li>
					<li>prototyped a new tag cache in the db that affects (and should speed up) many tag fetching routines. let's see how it goes</li>
					<li>added complete, global proxy support for the new network engine! there are new options under options->connection (with some explanation text) to handle it. if pysocks is installed, socks4/5 proxies are also available!</li>
					<li>updated the e-hentai.org login script to the new one on the github. your existing mappings for e-hentai.org _should_ all be updated right. exhentai.org is likely too difficult to properly support in the current system</li>
					<li>the different panels where you enter system predicate information now all run on the new panel sizing system--if you have had problems with these, please let me know how they size now!</li>
					<li>added a '4channel thread' url class to support watchers for the new 4channel sfw domain. it works for now, but let's see if their api changes when the split actually happens</li>
					<li>the list right-click menu on gallery import and thread watcher panels now has three options to show combined importers' files--presented, new, and all. it also now shows the files (more smoothly) in the same page, clearing any existing highlight.</li>
					<li>misc ui improvements</li>
					<li>updated 'running from source' in help</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 330</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>login:</li>
					<li>added a proper username/password login script for hentai foundry--double-check your hf filters are set how you want in your profile, and your hydrus should inherit the same rules</li>
					<li>fixed the gelbooru login script from last week, which typoed safebooru.com instead of .org</li>
					<li>fixed the pixiv login 'link' to correctly say nsfw rather than everything, which wasn't going through last week right</li>
					<li>improved the pixiv file page api parser to veto on 'could not access nsfw due to not logged in' status, although in further testing, this state seems to be rarer than previously/completely gone</li>
					<li>added login scripts from the github for shimmie, sankaku, and e-hentai--thanks to Cuddlebear and any other users who helped put these together</li>
					<li>added safebooru.donmai.us to danbooru login</li>
					<li>improved the deviant art file page parser to get the 'full' embedded image link at higher preference than the standard embed, and only get the 'download' button if it looks like an image (hence, deviant art should stop getting 140MB brush zips!)</li>
					<li>the manage logins panel now says when a login is expected to expire</li>
					<li>the manage logins dialog now has a 'scrub invalidity' button to 'try again' a login that broke due to server error or similar</li>
					<li>entering blank/invalid credentials is now permitted in the manage logins panel, and if entered on an 'active' domain, it will additionally deactivate it automatically</li>
					<li>the manage logins panel is better at figuring out and updating validity after changes</li>
					<li>the 'required cookies' in login scripts and steps now use string match names! hence, dynamically named cookies can now be checked! all existing checks are updated to fixed-string string matches</li>
					<li>improved some cookie lookup code</li>
					<li>improved some login manager script-updating code</li>
					<li>deleted all the old legacy login code</li>
					<li>misc login ui cleanup and fixes</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>other:</li>
					<li>sped up tag searches in certain situations (usually huge inbox) by using a different optimisation</li>
					<li>increased the repository mappings processing chunk size from 1k to 50k, which greatly increases processing in certain situations. let's see how it goes for different users--I may revisit the pipeline here to make it more flexible for faster and slower hard drives</li>
					<li>many of the 'select from a list of texts' dialogs--such as when you select a gallery to download from--are now on the new panel system. the list will grow and shrink depending on its length and available screen real estate</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc:</li>
					<li>extended my new dialog panel code so it can ask a question before an OK happens</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with scanning through videos that have non-integer frame-counts due to previous misparsing</li>
					<li>fixed a issue where file import objects that have been removed from the list but were still lingering on the list ui were not rendering their (invalid) index correctly</li>
					<li>when export folders fail to do their work, the error is now presented in a better way and all export folders are paused</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the export files dialog could not boot if the most previous export phrase was invalid</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter page now has a button to more easily edit the default merge options</li>
					<li>increased the sibling/parent refresh delay for 1s to 8s</li>
					<li>hydrus repository sync fails due to network login issues or manual network user cancel will now be caught properly and a reasonable delay added</li>
					<li>additional errors on repository sync will cause a reasonable delay on future work but still elevate the error</li>
					<li>converted import folder management ui to the new panel system</li>
					<li>refactored import folder ui code to ClientGUIImport.py</li>
					<li>converted export folder management ui to the new panel system</li>
					<li>refactored export folder ui code to the new ClientGUIExport.py</li>
					<li>refactored manual file export ui code to ClientGUIExport.py</li>
					<li>deleted some very old imageboard dumping management code</li>
					<li>deleted some very old contact management code</li>
					<li>did a little prep work for some 'show background image behind thumbs', including the start of a bitmap manager. I'll give it another go later</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 329</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>login:</li>
					<li>the login manager is fully turned on! hentai-foundry click-through and pixiv login now occur fully on the new system</li>
					<li>wrote a Deviant Art login script for NSFW downloading--however, it only seems to work on a client that has done some logged-out downloading first (otherwise it thinks you are a robot)</li>
					<li>updated the DA file page parser to only NSFW-veto if the user is currently logged out</li>
					<li>wrote a danbooru login script for user prefs and special files if you have a gold account</li>
					<li>wrote a gelbooru 0.2.x login script for user prefs</li>
					<li>pixiv recently(?) allowed non-logged in users to see sfw content, so the login script is updated to reflect this. the login script doesn't detect a failed login any more, so I will revisit this</li>
					<li>logging in in the regular order of things now makes a temporary popup message with the overall login status and final result. ~it is cancellable~--and if cancelled, future login attempts will be delayed</li>
					<li>logging in in the regular order of things now prints simple started/result lines to the log</li>
					<li>deleted old network->login menu and related code such as the custom pixiv login management. gdpr click-through is now under downloaders</li>
					<li>subscription login errors will now specify the given login failure reason</li>
					<li>subscription login tests will now occur at a better time, guaranteeing the sub will be correctly saved paused if the test fails</li>
					<li>login errors will now always specify the domain for which they failed</li>
					<li>testing a login script on a fresh edit login script dialog now pre-fills the alphabetically first example domain</li>
					<li>the login script test ui now restores its 'run test' button correctly if the test is abandoned early</li>
					<li>misc improvements to login error handling and reporting</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>other:</li>
					<li>any texts across the program that ellipsize when they are too thin to display what they have will now tooltip their text (this most importantly includes the status on the network job control, which will now display full login problem info)</li>
					<li>the copy button on manage tags goes back to copying all if no tags are selected</li>
					<li>the remove button on manage tags now removes only selected if some tags are selected. it still removes all if none are selected</li>
					<li>the remove button on manage tags is now wrapped in a yes/no dialog (as is hitting the delete key on the list's selection). this can be turned off under the cog button</li>
					<li>filename tagging panels now support directory tagging for the last, second last, and third last directories. the related code for handling directory tagging is cleaned up significantly</li>
					<li>the export files panel now lets you delete the files from the client after export. this value will be remembered, and if on will prompt a capital letters warning on export, either via the button or the quick-export shortcut</li>
					<li>in manage tag parents, where there are multiple parents in a pending action (either by importing via clipboard/file or by putting multiple parents in right-hand box), the action will now be treated as one transaction with one 'enter a reason' confirmation!</li>
					<li>in manage tag siblings, when multiple 'better' values are pended in one action via a clipboard/file import, they will now be treated as one transaction with one 'enter a reason' confirmation!</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc:</li>
					<li>added a new url class that api-links .gifv-style imgur links so they are downloadable like regular imgur single media pages</li>
					<li>the pixiv manga page url class now redirects to the new api, so mode=manga pages should now be drag-and-drop importable and generally downloadable if you have any still hanging around in any queues</li>
					<li>clients now come with an additional danbooru parser that fetches the webm version of ugoiras</li>
					<li>after discovering a pdf that ate indefinite 100% CPU while trying to parse, I have decided to stop pulling num_words for pdfs. it was always a super inaccurate number, so let's wait for a better solution at a later date. hydrus hence no longer requires pypdf2</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with monthly bandwidth estimates rolling over to the new year incorrectly</li>
					<li>in an attempt to chase down a duplicate files content move/copy bug, the duplicate action content updates got a bit of cleanup work. if you have noticed duplicate actions not copying tags/urls, please let me know the exact process in the ui, including services and merge options, you went through</li>
					<li>tag lists should now update their sibling appearance correctly after a tag siblings dialog ok--previously, they were checking for new sibs too early</li>
					<li>tag siblings and parents should now refresh their data more efficiently when spammed with new data notifications (this usually happens janitor-side, which approving dozens at once)</li>
					<li>copy queries/watcher urls on the download pages' lists' right-click menus no longer double-spaces the copied texts (it just does single spaces)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where certain initialised watchers were erroring out when asked to provide next-check time estimates--in all cases, null timestamps will be dealt with better here</li>
					<li>misc tag parents/siblings ui code cleanup</li>
					<li>wrote some code to catch and report on an unusual dialog dismissal error</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 328</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote test ui for edit login script panel</li>
					<li>the login system now works and is turned on, although the legacy hardcoded pixiv and hf logins remain in place. it will not do anything very new this week--it is strictly only for advanced users to experiment with for now</li>
					<li>cleaned up some messy network code</li>
					<li>all subscription and hydrus jobs will no longer wait indefinitely on an invalid login--they will cancel immediately</li>
					<li>network jobs will report a bit more info when they are cancelled</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now attempt to test login validity before and during file downloads and syncing. if they fail, the sub will pause and stop work and a message will be presented to the user</li>
					<li>made a 'thumbnails' options page and moved some things to it</li>
					<li>added thumbnail border and margin to that thumbnails page! you can even set 0 border and/or margin and it works</li>
					<li>fixed up a heap of bad thumbnail drawing code that didn't work with thicker borders</li>
					<li>the tag sibling and parent dialogs now have suggestion buttons in their 'give a reason' dialogs! if your petitions are simple and fit into one of these categories (which is most of them), please use these buttons as they will let janitors (e.g. hydrus dev for the PTR) process them in batches, in fewer clicks</li>
					<li>manage tags dialog's checkboxes and advanced buttons are now wrapped into a cog icon! remove/copy/paste buttons are compacted and put on the same row!</li>
					<li>manage tags dialog's copy button now only copies selected, not all tags</li>
					<li>manage tags dialog now uses the new sizer. some components are smaller by default but will eat up spare pixels better</li>
					<li>misc manage tags code cleanup</li>
					<li>added 'paged file import queues' to the network->pause menu. this will pause any, hdd, url, simple, gallery, or watcher page from processing its file import queue. it is a bit hacky and will take up to 30s to unpause unless you joggle the respective downloader to wake it up--see how it goes!</li>
					<li>added a similar 'gallery searching' to that menu, to pause any url, simple, or gallery page from actioning its gallery-side queue</li>
					<li>and 'watcher checking' for watchers</li>
					<li>fixed a stupid bug that was causing false-positive and _mostly_ harmless errors for certain pixiv and artstation multi-page downloads</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where multi-page data was being mis-metadata'd (mostly, this meant thread watchers were giving the last filename tag to all files, and I think similarly getting the latest source time) due to a mistake in some recent de-duping code</li>
					<li>fixed the new pixiv file page api parser to parse source time, which I must have accidentally deleted previously</li>
					<li>fixed a no-expand bug in my new sizer when in horizontal orientation</li>
					<li>fixed a small bug when making an easy-import downloader png and cancelling the add url class dialog</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 327</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>login stuff:</li>
					<li>finished off some login script data stuff</li>
					<li>fleshed out how login credentials and other linked data is stored in the login manager, including script link recovery when the script changes but name does not</li>
					<li>improved some initialisation login validation error handling</li>
					<li>improved login failure validation error handling</li>
					<li>wrote a dialog panel for managing login credentials and reviewing validity and so on</li>
					<li>a heap of related session and login tie-in/fix-up work</li>
					<li>the login manager will now save changes to the db. it will get the HF and pixiv scripts on db creation/update, and if you have a pixiv login, the login system will pre-fill that info and 'activate' the script (although the login manager will not fire any login scripts yet--if so configured, it'll just delay on a polite error message)</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>other stuff:</li>
					<li>with the subscriptions' new more liberal syncing logic, the periodic file limit will now only pop up if the sub does not see any already-seen files</li>
					<li>to give more buffer for the new syncing logic, file import caches will now store 250 entries minimum on compaction (was 100 previously)</li>
					<li>subscription merging now lets you choose the primary subscription into which the other subs will be merged</li>
					<li>cancelling a subscription merge action mid-merge is now safely nullipotent</li>
					<li>post urls that use subsidiary page parsers (such as the new pixiv manga parser) will now correctly insert (rather than append) their manga urls into the file import cache</li>
					<li>removed a couple of places where urls could accidentally be duplicated in a file import cache</li>
					<li>cleaned up some areas where successful file import objects were presumed to have file hashes when they might not (this was causing errors when importing urls that split into multiple url children, like pixiv manga, while also having 'additional tags' set)</li>
					<li>updated tag censorship, parents, and siblings dialogs to the new panel system</li>
					<li>tag censorship, parents, and siblings panels now use a notebook instead of the layout-borked listbook</li>
					<li>tag parents and siblings panels now use the new small-resolution-friendly sizer, are more tight by default, and expand more neatly</li>
					<li>refactored a bunch of tag ui code to clientguitags</li>
					<li>the client video renderer will now deal with videos with (invalid) duration of 0 more gracefully</li>
					<li>finished the 'getting started with downloading' help page, sans the login stuff</li>
					<li>bit of other help work</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 326</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>login:</li>
					<li>finished the new login objects. they can deal with multi-step single second-level domain login problems, can pass variables from step to step, and use cookies as success verification</li>
					<li>wrote an ton of ui for the new login objects, now under network->downloader definitions and network->logins. it is not 'active' yet, but advanced users are invited to check it out. there is no good test ui yet, which I think I'll have to figure out in the coming weeks</li>
					<li>wrote a first attempt at HF and pixiv replacement login scripts--please try importing from defaults on the manage login scripts dialog and look through them to see what I am going for. once the system is flipped on and we are happy these work, I'll remove the old hardcoded legacy login stuff</li>
					<li>when a network job that needs a login cannot login, it now waits (rather than bombing out completely), presenting the related error, and checks again every 60 seconds</li>
					<li>if a network job thinks it can login but fails to generate a login process, the network engine now catches the error safely and recovers. the job is put on hold as above</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>subs:</li>
					<li>the subscription 'have we caught up to where we were before' test is now more complicated--rather than just stopping after five 'already seen' urls are found, it now only stops if at least the _last_ five contiguous urls of the page are already seen. this will catch more late-tagged files that get inserted out of order</li>
					<li>fixed the 'get quality info' button on edit sub panel to only get the current selection, not all queries wew</li>
					<li>subscriptions can now optionally publish/present their files to a specific label! this is a great way to merge multiple subs to the same final landing page</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>layout:</li>
					<li>after a long time thinking about it, wrote a new custom boxsizer that handles resizing multiple expanding items of different reasonable min size by expanding them _beyond minimum size_ by their proportion, rather than forcing them all to have total proportional width/height. I expect to polish this and apply it in multiple locations around the program where tall things were being too tall because something else was forcing it to be (the management panel on the left of most pages was terrible at this, causing a giganto taglist just because the upper panel was tall as well).</li>
					<li>changed my custom boxsizer (the box with a bold header) to the new custom boxsizer, so it is all over now--please report any bad layouts you see</li>
					<li>in an effort to improve layout, the manage tag parents and siblings panels' preview boxes have shorter minimum height--it will get a bigger layout overhaul soon</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>bigger misc:</li>
					<li>thanks to work of user kourraxspam on the discord, fixed the pixiv downloader to use a more stable api and added pixiv tag search</li>
					<li>watchers and gallery imports now have a list right-click menu entry to show all selected importers' files in a new page! use this to clear out a bunch of finished queues all at once!</li>
					<li>the tag right-click menu now offers 'open new search pages for each in selection' if multiple tags are selected--this will open three search pages each with one tag, as opposed to the original entry, which would only open one page with all three</li>
					<li>the edit nested gug panel now uses a checklistbox rather than the menu to select gugs to add, which is more reliable and allows for multiple selections</li>
					<li>sped up autocomplete tag fetches' tag sibling integration--irl this may be a reduction in total a/c search time of approx 33%</li>
					<li>page parsers will now generate next gallery urls absent any file/post urls if the only type of url they can generate is gallery urls (so a meta-gallery-search like board->threads that only generates subsidiary gallery pages will now work, whereas before it never could because it was missing post urls)</li>
					<li>the gallery log now provides a shorthand way to restart and resume failed searches from its right-click menu (if the most recent log entry failed)</li>
					<li>'try again (and allow search to continue)' reattempt jobs will now generate next page urls even if no new urls are found (which can happen if a search stopped due to the file limit exactly lining up with the number of files found, for instance, so a reattempt finds nothing new)</li>
					<li>gallery downloaders will now specify their 'delay work for a bit' error states in the ui. this usually means 'could not connect', which has a 4-hour timer (I'll prob add a scrub delays button here at some point)</li>
					<li>the watcher will now show its 'delay work for a bit' error state in more places in the ui</li>
					<li>added a 'media' shortcut 'export_files_quick_auto_export', which will open the export files frame and give you a quick yes/no to confirm you want to export as set. if yes, it will export. then it will close the frame</li>
					<li>added a 'show a "N" to short import summaries' option to options->downloading, which will extend the typical 'x/y' status string to 'x/y - zN' for z 'new files' (as opposed to already in db)</li>
					<li>improved how the video parser estimates frame rate--it _should_ fix some of those low-framerate, low-framecount slideshow-vids where at current they render everything in a rush and then sit on the last frame for ten secs</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>smaller misc:</li>
					<li>network report mode now reports url_to_fetch and parser-to-parse-with info</li>
					<li>when the server fails to accept a file upload due to a file parsing issue, it now prints the hash of the file in the error</li>
					<li>if the client sees a possible file hash in a server error message from a file upload, ~it will try to show that file in a new page~</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where wildcard searches were not finding results if the search text included the normally discarded characters [](){}"'</li>
					<li>fixed some domain handling for localhost and other undotted network names</li>
					<li>content parsers will now only launch with permissable content types, which for the legacy 'lookup scripts' scripts system means only tags and vetoes, and for the new login system means only temp variables and vetoes</li>
					<li>as compaction now happens automatically on sync, removed the 'compact' button from edit subs panel</li>
					<li>an unusual network error related to hydrus update files sometimes being cut off mid-stream is now glossed over silently, with the download reattempted after a delay</li>
					<li>the initial gui session load now occurs after a 0.25s delay--let's see if it cleans up some initial layout issues some users have had</li>
					<li>maybe fixed an odd dictionary-initialisation error related to tag siblings/parents dialog boot</li>
					<li>ruggedised against an unusual bandwidth load bug</li>
					<li>gave some of the index help a pass</li>
					<li>did most of a 'getting started with downloaders' page in the help--I'll finish it next week</li>
					<li>updated discord share link to https://discord.gg/3H8UTpb , which should not expire</li>
					<li>some listbox add/edit code cleanup</li>
					<li>some listctrl delete code cleanup</li>
					<li>misc help work</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 325</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added a 'show a popup while working' checkbox to edit subscription panel--be careful with it, I think maybe only turn it off after you are happy everything is set up right and the sub has run once</li>
					<li>advanced mode users will see a new 'get quality info' button on the edit subscription panel. this will some ugly+hacky inbox/archived/deleted info on the selected queries to help you figure out if you are only archiving, say, 2% of one query. this is a quickly made but cpu-expensive way of calculating this info. I can obviously expand it in future, so I would appreciate your thoughts</li>
					<li>subscription queries now have an optional display name, which has no bearing on their function but if set will appear instead of query text in various presentation contexts (this is useful, for instance, if the downloader query text deals in something unhelpful like integer artist_id)</li>
					<li>subscription queries now each have a simple tag import options! this only allows 'additional tags', in case you want to add some simple per-query tags</li>
					<li>selecting 'try again' on file imports that previously failed due to 'deleted' will now pop up a little yes/no asking if you would like to first erase these files' previously deleted file record!</li>
					<li>the watcher and gallery import panels now have 'retry failed' buttons and right-click menu entries when appropriate</li>
					<li>the watcher and gallery import panels will now do some ui update less frequently when they contain a lot of data</li>
					<li>fixed the new human-friendly tag sorting code for ungrouped lexicographic sort orders, where it was accidentally grouping by namespace</li>
					<li>downloader easy-import pngs can now hold custom header and bandwidth rules metadata! this info, if explicitly present for the appropriate domain, will be added automatically on the export side as you add gugs. it can also be bundled separately after manually typing a domain to add. on the import side, it is now listed as a new type. longer human-friendly descriptions of all bandwidth and header information being bundled will be displayed during the export and import processes, just as an additional check</li>
					<li>for advanced users, added 'do not skip downloading because of known urls/hashes' options to downloader file import options. these checkboxes work like the tag import options ones--ignoring known urls and hashes to force downloads. they are advanced and should not be used unless you have a particular problem to fix</li>
					<li>improved how the pre-import url/hash checking code is compared for the tag and file import options, particularly on the hash side</li>
					<li>for advanced users, added 'associate additional source urls' to downloader file import options, which governs whether a site's given 'source urls' should be added and trusted for downloaded files. turn this off if the site is giving bad source urls</li>
					<li>fixed an unusual problem where gallery searches with search terms that included the search separator (like '6+girls skirt', with a separator of '+') were being overzealously de/encoded (to '6+girls+skirt' rather than '6%2bgirls+skirt')</li>
					<li>improved how unicode quoted characters in URLs' query parameters, like %E5%B0%BB%E7%A5%9E%E6%A7%98 are auto-converted to something prettier when the user sees them</li>
					<li>the client now tests if 'already in db' results are actually backed by the file structure--now, if a the actual file is missing despite the db record, the import will be force-attempted and the file structure hopefully healed</li>
					<li>gallery url jobs will no longer spawn new 'next page' urls if the job yielded 0 _new_ (rather than _total_) file urls (so we should have fixed loops fetching the same x 'already in file import cache' results due to the gallery just passing the same results for n+1 page fetches)</li>
					<li>in the edit parsing panels, if the example data currently looks like json, new content parsers will spawn with json formulae, otherwise they will get html formulae</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the default twitter tweet parser pulling the wrong month for source time</li>
					<li>added a simple 'media load report mode' to the help debug menu to help figure out some PIL/OpenCV load order stuff</li>
					<li>the 'missing locations recovery' dialog that spawns on boot if file locations are missing now uses the new listctrl, so is thankfully sortable! it also works better behind the scenes</li>
					<li>this dialog now also has an 'add a possibly correct location' button, which will scan the given directory for the correct prefixes and automatically fill in the list for you</li>
					<li>fixed some of the new import folder error reporting</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 324</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>downloaders:</li>
					<li>after adding some small new parser tools, wrote a new pixiv downloader that should work with their new dynamic gallery's api. it fetches all an artist's work in one page. some existing pixiv download components will be renamed and detached from your existing subs and downloaders. your existing subs may switch over to the correct pixiv downloader automatically, or you may need to manually set them (you'll get a popup to remind you).</li>
					<li>wrote a twitter username lookup downloader. it should skip retweets. it is a bit hacky, so it may collapse if they change something small with their internal javascript api. it fetches 19-20 tweets per 'page', so if the account has 20 rts in a row, it'll likely stop searching there. also, afaik, twitter browsing only works back 3200 tweets or so. I recommend proceeding slowly.</li>
					<li>added a simple gelbooru 0.1.11 file page parser to the defaults. it won't link to anything by default, but it is there if you want to put together some booru.org stuff</li>
					<li>you can now set your default/favourite download source under options->downloading</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc:</li>
					<li>the 'do idle work on shutdown' system will now only ask/run once per x time units (including if you say no to the ask dialog). x is one day by default, but can be set in 'maintenance and processing'</li>
					<li>added 'max jobs' and 'max jobs per domain' to options->connection. defaults remain 15 and 3</li>
					<li>the colour selection buttons across the program now have a right-click menu to import/export #FF0000 hex codes from/to the clipboard</li>
					<li>tag namespace colours and namespace rendering options are moved from 'colours' and 'tags' options pages to 'tag summaries', which is renamed to 'tag presentation'</li>
					<li>the Lain import dropper now supports pngs with single gugs, url classes, or parsers--not just fully packaged downloaders</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where trying to remove a selection of files from the duplicate system (through the advanced duplicates menu) would only apply to the first pair of files</li>
					<li>improved some error reporting related to too-long filenames on import</li>
					<li>improved error handling for the folder-scanning stage in import folders--now, when it runs into an error, it will preserve its details better, notify the user better, and safely auto-pause the import folder</li>
					<li>png export auto-filenames will now be sanitized of \, /, :, *-type OS-path-invalid characters as appropriate as the dialog loads</li>
					<li>the 'loading subs' popup message should appear more reliably (after 1s delay) if the first subs are big and loading slow</li>
					<li>fixed the 'fullscreen switch' hover window button for the duplicate filter</li>
					<li>deleted some old hydrus session management code and db table</li>
					<li>some other things that I lost track of. I think it was mostly some little dialog fixes :/</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>advanced downloader stuff:</li>
					<li>the test panel on pageparser edit panels now has a 'post pre-parsing conversion' notebook page that shows the given example data after the pre-parsing conversion has occurred, including error information if it failed. it has a summary size/guessed type description and copy and refresh buttons.</li>
					<li>the 'raw data' copy/fetch/paste buttons and description are moved down to the raw data page</li>
					<li>the pageparser now passes up this post-conversion example data to sub-objects, so they now start with the correctly converted example data</li>
					<li>the subsidiarypageparser edit panel now also has a notebook page, also with brief description and copy/refresh buttons, that summarises the raw separated data</li>
					<li>the subsidiary page parser now passes up the first post to its sub-objects, so they now start with a single post's example data</li>
					<li>content parsers can now sort the strings their formulae get back. you can sort strict lexicographic or the new human-friendly sort that does numbers properly, and of course you can go ascending or descending--if you can get the ids of what you want but they are in the wrong order, you can now easily fix it!</li>
					<li>some json dict parsing code now iterates through dict keys lexicographically ascending by default. unfortunately, due to how the python json parser I use works, there isn't a way to process dict items in the original order</li>
					<li>the json parsing formula now uses a string match when searching for dictionary keys, so you can now match multiple keys here (as in the pixiv illusts|manga fix). existing dictionary key look-ups will be converted to 'fixed' string matches</li>
					<li>the json parsing formula can now get the content type 'dictionary keys', which will fetch all the text keys in the dictionary/Object, if the api designer happens to have put useful data in there, wew</li>
					<li>formulae now remove newlines from their parsed texts before they are sent to the StringMatch! so, if you are grabbing some multi-line html and want to test for 'Posted: ' somewhere in that mess, it is now easy.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 323</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote first version of the new downloader easy-import drop-panel. you drop downloader-encoded pngs on it, and it maybe asks you a question and jumbles its way through auto-importing all the required data to the client</li>
					<li>extended this file import to do some cleverer 'example url merging' when parsers are otherwise dupes, rather than spamming similar dupes on import</li>
					<li>wrote first version of the new downloader export panel. it takes gugs, url classes and parsers, and predicts sensible sub-objects to include to make functional downloaders, and bundles it into one png</li>
					<li>fleshed out help for the new easy import/export system</li>
					<li>the client now slows down gallery and watcher processing when the network engine is under heavy load, aiming for no more than 50 jobs in system at once. the solution is a bit hacky for now, but it should alleviate the deadlock issue when there are ~180+ simultaneous gallery/watcher network jobs pending</li>
					<li>the multi-watcher panel's list of watchers now supports right-click menu to copy/open urls and pause/play files/checking</li>
					<li>the multi-downloader panel's list of downloaders now supports right-click menu to copy query texts and pause/play files/searching</li>
					<li>added a 'derpibooru tag search - no filter' GUG that disables the default derpi no-explicit-files rule</li>
					<li>added basic gfycat support to default client--drag and drop any typical video page, and it should import ok</li>
					<li>fixed the canvas/hover window tag sorting discrepancy--all tags are now sorted with the same code, and the media view sort order should be the same as your default sort order (although in this case incidence has no effect as there are no tag counts)</li>
					<li>rewrote the network job control's cog menu to be a bit more dynamic, and added 'override gallery slot requirements for this job' if appropriate</li>
					<li>fixed a stupid typo bug in the shutdown maintenance jobs test code that was causing pending repository work to not report right</li>
					<li>fixed gallery searches that include unicode characters that end up in the path of the url (rather than the query parameters)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where highlighting a watcher would unpause its checking</li>
					<li>generalised the way the new listctrl class can produce right-click menus</li>
					<li>fixed some api link calculation that was over-prescribing api link display pairs (this affected the artstation file page url class by default). these pairs are now also sorted in the links dialog</li>
					<li>misc png-export improvements to present better with the new easy import/export stuff</li>
					<li>the summary texts in the tag filter panel now ellipsize (...), so if the tag filter is complicated, it won't try to boot a superwide edit panel!</li>
					<li>the manage subscriptions panel now correctly initially sorts in a case-insensitive way (previously, it was usually sorting A-Za-z, which is different to regular aA-zZ resorting behaviour, so it always sort-flickered after the first edit)</li>
					<li>the status bar has a new segment for reporting when the client is 'busy' with different jobs. for most typical usage, it'll just stay blank. let's see how it goes.</li>
					<li>fixed mr. bones's wild review when the client currently has no files</li>
					<li>punched up the new file report mode to specify full paths where available</li>
					<li>improved some misc downloader code</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 322</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote gugs help</li>
					<li>gave url classes and parsers help a pass</li>
					<li>wrote e621 html gallery page example help</li>
					<li>wrote gelbooru html file page example help</li>
					<li>wrote artstation json file page example help</li>
					<li>wrote url class links help</li>
					<li>gallery logs for the gallery downloader and url downloader now support 'try again' and 'skip' right-click menu for gallery log entries. the try again allows just the one page or also allowing search to continue) so, if a gallery query fails for some reason, you can now try again/continue where it broke. subs/watcher/simple downloader work on more complicated gallery search logic, so their gallery logs will remain read-only for now</li>
					<li>all gallery log buttons now support right-click menu to mass-export urls to png or clipboard. non read-only also support import</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with gallery searches that rely on both api url conversions and url class next gallery page urls (I think just artstation and tumblr by default) not generating the next page url correctly</li>
					<li>improved some misc gallery url processing logic</li>
					<li>fixed some issues with gallery url generators with invalid example urls causing problems opening the edit gug and gallery selector panels</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where you could only delete a gug if it was in an ngug, ha ha</li>
					<li>thanks to a different submission by prkc on the discord, collections now have a _right-click->set collections as groups of alternates_ duplicate action (note the duplicate menu only appears in advanced mode). the related shortcut action duplicate_media_set_alternate_collections is also added</li>
					<li>export phrases now support '\' ('/' in linux) in the path export phrase in order to create folders. you should also be able to do \[series]\ to create optional namespace folders. slashes in tags will still be replaced with _</li>
					<li>to stop the client sometimes doing laggy vacuum checks every maintenance cycle, vacuums that cannot occur due to limited disk space now will still count as 'done' for the purposes of rescheduling</li>
					<li>added 'file report mode' to the help debug menu. This will spam popups as file and thumbnail actions are requested</li>
					<li>tightened up some network job status setting to help us debug the 'there are a ton of jobs in network engine, but the three active on this domain seem stalled' issue</li>
					<li>wrote a simple 'review threads' panel under help->debug->data actions->review threads. I knocked it together in about ten minutes, and it's likely unstable as hell, but it's pretty neat!</li>
					<li>some instances where many file paths are copied quickly (exporting paths to clipboard and drag and drop) no longer do a safety check for file existence, so should be much faster to go. this particularly reduces startup lag for large file drag and drops!</li>
					<li>the 'would you like to do maintenance work in this shutdown?' dialog now lists a summary of what it thinks it'll be working on. I _could_ make this more detailed, so let me know how it works for you</li>
					<li>tags with numbers should now sort according to the new improved human sorting method--it now shouldn't matter where the numbers are in the tag--as long as the text-and-number-breaks lines up with another tag, they'll be compared each part in turn correctly</li>
					<li>fixed some human sorting code for unusual number characters like ?. they will be treated as text, not a number, for now</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 321</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>downloader overhaul:</li>
					<li>the basic downloader overhaul is complete! at this point, any user can create and share the objects required for a completely new downloader! it is still rough in some places, so a round of EZ-import is coming to make adding new downloaders a single easy drag and drop action</li>
					<li>rounded out the ngug (nested gugs, which contain multiple gugs) code</li>
					<li>updated the edit gug panel to deal with gugs and ngugs on different notebook pages</li>
					<li>added a bunch of logic to this panel and backend data handling to deal with missing gugs in ngugs</li>
					<li>if an ngug cannot find a gug by its internal identifier key, it will now attempt to fallback to its simple name, and will silently fail if no gug can be found. all gug tracking now uses this 'key first, name later' id method, so downloaders and subs should generally survive gug renames and same-name overwrites</li>
					<li>the gallery selector now works in gugs. it has two 'pages', depending on which gugs are set to 'display', and will note if the chosen gug is cannot be found in the current definitions. the gugs have slightly more specific names ('gelbooru tag search', 'hentai foundry artist lookup', etc...) than before</li>
					<li>the gallery selector also puts 'non-functional' gugs (i.e. those with no parsable gallery url class) to a third page</li>
					<li>moved the gallery downloader gallery and file pipeline completely over to the new system</li>
					<li>the gallery downloader will now bundle nested gugs (like hentai foundry artist, which searches both works and scraps) into a single downloader</li>
					<li>moved the subs gallery and file pipeline comppletely over to the new system</li>
					<li>the subs gallery sync now handles nested gugs (like hentai foundry artist, which searches both works and scraps) in an interleaved manner and make behind-the-scenes checking decisions in a clearer and more logical way</li>
					<li>subs should now make correct 'hit limit' stop reason reports and not generate new gallery pages when the current page has exactly enough results to hit the current file limit</li>
					<li>artstation artist lookup is now available as a default downloader</li>
					<li>newgrounds artist lookup makes a triumphant return. it works pretty well, given how flash and NG has changed since</li>
					<li>derpibooru tag lookup is now available as a default downloader. due to unusual search syntax on derpibooru, please enter queries exactly as you would on derpi, using ',' or ' AND ' to separate tags (such as 'rainbow dash,straight')</li>
					<li>pixiv now has multiple artist lookup options--either images, manga, ugoira (doesn't work yet!), or everything</li>
					<li>the old downloader code is deleted!</li>
					<li>the old manage booru dialog is deleted!</li>
					<li>'custom' boorus (i.e. new ones you created or imported to 'manage boorus'), cannot be completely automatically updated to the new system. I've figured out a way to generate new gugs and gallery&post parsers, but they will miss url classes to get working again. your custom-booru subs will notice this and safely pause until the issue is fixed. if you rely on custom boorus, please check the release post for info on this--you might like to put off updating</li>
					<li>many misc changes and fixes to gugs and overall gallery url handling pipeline</li>
					<li>some misc refactoring and concept-renaming in gallery pipeline r.e. gugs</li>
					<li>when the downloader tries to import what looks like a raw html file, its error notes will specify this and suggest a parser may be needed</li>
					<li>moved the 'media viewer url display' options panel from the manage url match links dialog to the new network->downloaders->manage downloader and url display</li>
					<li>this new dialog also hosts a list for managing which downloaders to show in the first list of the downloader selector</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc:</li>
					<li>gave the video rendering pipeline communication logic a quick pass, cleaning up a bunch of bad code and other decisions. the video renderer should be quicker to respond to various changes in scanbar position, and incidences of the frame buffer suddenly sperging out (usually inexplicably falling behind the current frame position or deciding to regen for no apparent reason) should be greatly reduced if not completely eliminated</li>
					<li>the test that stops repository processing if there is not enough disk space now uses half the current size of client.mappings.db for its estimate (previously 1GB) and also tests temp folder location free space (just as the vacuum test does) and reports this nature of the error along with pausing the repo, stopping further attempts</li>
					<li>might have fixed another out-of-order dialog close/open event combination during manage tags close->advanced content update open</li>
					<li>fixed gallery queries that include '/' (or some other unusual characters) that end up in the 'path' of the url (as opposed to the query). this fixes 'male/female' on e621, for instance</li>
					<li>'advanced mode' users now have a 'nudge subs awake' menu entry below 'manage subs'. this simply wakes the subs daemon (which usually only checks once every four hours), in case any subs are due</li>
					<li>'db report mode' now reports every db job as it comes in (formerly, it only reported some optimisation esoterica). this makes it a more lightweight version of 'db profile mode' for several debugging tasks</li>
					<li>fixed a tiny issue in fetching the 'how boned am I?' stats when the user had zero inbox/everything count</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in the default new url class object that was breaking the edit ui panel</li>
					<li>highlighted the quiet filename tagging options on edit import folder panel</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 320</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>clients should now have objects for all default downloaders. everything should be prepped for the big switchover:</li>
					<li>wrote gallery url generators for all the default downloaders and a couple more as well</li>
					<li>wrote a gallery parser for deviant art--it also comes with an update to the DA url class because the meta 'next page' link on DA gallery pages is invalid wew!</li>
					<li>wrote a gallery parser for hentai foundry, inkbunny, rule34hentai, moebooru (konachan, sakugabooru, yande.re), artstation, newgrounds, and pixiv artist galleries (static html)</li>
					<li>added a gallery parser for sankaku</li>
					<li>the artstation post url parser no longer fetches cover images</li>
					<li>url classes can now support 'default' values for path components and query parameters! so, if your url might be missing a page=1 initialsation value due to user drag-and-drop, you can auto-add it in the normalisation step!</li>
					<li>if the entered default does not match the rules of the component or parameter, it will be cleared back to none!</li>
					<li>all appropriate default gallery url classes (which is most) now have these default values. all default gallery url classes will be overwritten on db update</li>
					<li>three test 'search initialisation' url classes that attempted to fix this problem a different way will be deleted on update, if present</li>
					<li>updated some other url classes</li>
					<li>when checking source urls during the pre-download import status check, the client will now distrust parsed source urls if the files they seem to refer to also have other urls of the same url class as the file import object being actioned (basically, this is some logic that tries to detect bad source url attribution, where multiple files on a booru (typically including alternate edits) are all source-url'd back to a single original)</li>
					<li>gallery page parsing now discounts parsed 'next page' urls that are the same as the page that fetched them (some gallery end-points link themselves as the next page, wew)</li>
					<li>json parsing formulae that are set to parse all 'list' items will now also parse all dictionary entries if faced with a dict instead!</li>
					<li>added new stop-gap 'stop checking' logic in subscription syncing for certain low-gallery-count edge-cases</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where (typically new) subscriptions were bugging out trying to figure a default stop_reason on certain page results</li>
					<li>fixed an unusual listctrl delete item index-tracking error that would sometimes cause exceptions on the 'try to link url stuff together' button press and maybe some other places</li>
					<li>thanks to a submission from user prkc on the discord, we now have 'import cookies.txt' buttons on the review sessions panels! if you are interested in 'manual' logins through browser-cookie-copying, please give this a go and let me know which kinds of cookies.txt do and do not work, and how your different site cookie-copy-login tests work in hydrus.</li>
					<li>the mappings cache tables now have some new indices that speed up certain kinds of tag search significantly. db update will spend a minute or two generating these indices for existing users</li>
					<li>advanced mode users will discover a fun new entry on the help menu</li>
					<li>the hyperlinks on the media viewer hover window and a couple of other places are now a custom control that uses any custom browser launch path in options->files and trash</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where certain canvas edge-case media clearing events could be caught incorrectly by the manage tags dialog and its subsidiary panels</li>
					<li>think I fixed an issue where a client left with a dialog open could sometimes run into trouble later trying to show an idle time maintenance modal popup and give a 'C++ assertion IsRunning()' exception and end up locking the client's ui</li>
					<li>manage parsers dialog will now autosort after an add event</li>
					<li>the gug panels now normalise example urls</li>
					<li>improved some misc service error handling</li>
					<li>rewrote some url parsing to stop forcing '+'->' ' in our urls' query texts</li>
					<li>fixed some bad error handling for matplotlib import</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 319</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>started the new convert-query-text-to-gallery-urls object. these objects, which I was thinking of calling 'Searchers', will be called the more specific and practical 'Gallery URL Generators', or GUGs for short</li>
					<li>the first version of GUGs is done, and I've written some test ui for advanced users under network->downloader definitions->manage gugs. this ui doesn't save anything yet, but lets you mess around with different values. if we don't think of anything else needed in the next week, I will fix this code for v320 and start filling in defaults</li>
					<li>watchers now have a checking slot, much like the recent change to galleries and subs. it safely throttles dozens of threads so they don't rudely hammer your (or the destination server's) CPU if they all happen to want to go at once (like just after your computer wakes up). the option is similarly under options->downloading</li>
					<li>moved the new gallery delay/token management code to the better-fit bandwidth manager (it was in domain manager before)</li>
					<li>the gallery delay/token code now works per-domain!</li>
					<li>moved the gallery delay/token checking code into the network job proper, simplifying a bunch of import-level code and making the text display now appear in the network job control. token consumption now occurs after bandwidth (it is now the last hoop to jump through, which reduces the chance of a pileup in unusual situations) I expect to soon add some kind of 'force-go' action to the cog menu</li>
					<li>the network engine will now not permit more than three jobs active per domain, and the overall limit has been raised from ten to fifteen</li>
					<li>the media right-click menu now supports copying: all of a files recognised urls; all of a files urls; all selected files' urls of a specific url class; and all selected files urls</li>
					<li>reworked and harmonised a bunch of urlparsing and generation code--all urls should now appear as full unicode across the program, generally without %20-type encoding characters unless explicitly entered by the user. character encoding now all happens on the backend in requests</li>
					<li>non-url-class-matched urls now have their query parameters alphabetised as part of the normalisation process</li>
					<li>all urls in the db will have their query params alphabetised on update, and any file relationships merged to the new/existing normalised url</li>
					<li>the manage urls dialog will now normalise newly added urls (but should also still permit the removal of non-normalised urls)</li>
					<li>reworked how gallery hits update file import object caches, particularly for subscriptions</li>
					<li>fixed an issue in subscriptions gallery logging where the gallery log would always state it had found the max number of files and typically redundantly generate an 'ignored' stub--it should now say something like 'found 7 files - saw 5 previously seen urls, so assuming we caught up' as originally intended</li>
					<li>simplified some gallery->file import object creation</li>
					<li>galleries now compact until 100 entries (was 25)</li>
					<li>watchers now gallery-compact after a successful check</li>
					<li>watchers now show the 'just added'/'already watching' status for 15s, up from 5s</li>
					<li>network report mode now reports three time--once each for job addition, start, and successful completion</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the new 'max width' popup sizing calculation that was sometimes not fitting for new height requirements correctly</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the new url class next page generation code</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where TIOs with data regarding since-deleted services were failing to initialise at the ui level</li>
					<li>misc status text cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 318</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>downloaders:</li>
					<li>extended url classes to support 'next gallery page' generation--a fallback that predicts next gallery page url if the parser cannot provide it (as is often the case with APIs and unreliable next-page-url galleries such as gelbooru)</li>
					<li>integrated this new next page generation into new gallery processing pipeline</li>
					<li>updated gelbooru, tumblr api and artstation gallery api url classes to support the new next gallery page business</li>
					<li>fixed the url class for xbooru, which wasn't recognising gallery urls correctly</li>
					<li>wrote new gallery parsers for rule34.paheal and mishimmie (which are both shimmie but have slightly different gallery layout). this should finally solve the 'one paheal gallery url is being parsed into the file list per page' problem</li>
					<li>'fixed' the tumblr parser to fetch the 1280px url (tumblr killed the raw url trick this past week)</li>
					<li>misc text/status fixes</li>
					<li>wrote a gallery parser for tumblr that fetches the actual tumblr post urls and hence uses the new tumblr post parser naturally! (tumblr post urls are now more neatly associated as 'known urls' on files!)</li>
					<li>note that as the tumblr downloader now produces different kinds of urls, your tumblr subs will hit your periodic limits the next time they run. they will also re-download any 1280px files that are different to the previously fetched raws due to the above raw change (protip: keep your subscription periodic file limits low)</li>
					<li>cut the 'periodic limit' subscription warning popup down to a much simpler statement and moved the accompanying help to a new help button on the edit sub panel</li>
					<li>multi-gallery pages now have an 'added' column like multi-watchers</li>
					<li>the new 'pause' ? and 'stop' ? characters shown in the multi-downloader pages are now customisable under options->downloading (some users had trouble with the unicode)</li>
					<li>the watcher now shows the 'stop character' if checking is 404/DEAD</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the new gallery imports on the same multi-page were all sharing the same identifier for their ephemeral 'downloader instance' bandwidth tracker, which meant they were all sharing the same '100rqs per 5mins' etc... rules</li>
					<li>the page and subscription downloader 'gallery page delay' is now program-wide (since both these things can run in mass parallel). let's see how it goes, maybe we'll move it to per-site</li>
					<li>subscription queries now auto-compact on sync! this means that surplus old urls will be removed from their caches, keeping the whole object lean and quick to load/save</li>
					<li>gallery logs now also compact! they will remove anything older than twice the current death velocity, but always keep the newest 25 regardless of age</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc:</li>
					<li>the top-right hover window will now always appear--previously, it would only pop up if the client had some ratings services, but this window now handles urls</li>
					<li>harmonised 'known urls' view/copy menu to a single code location and added sorted url class labels to entries (which should reduce direct-file-url misclicks)</li>
					<li>greatly sped up manage tags dialogs initial calculation of possible actions on a tag alteration event, particularly when the dialog holds 10k+ tags</li>
					<li>greatly sped up the second half of this process, when the action choice is applied to the manage tag dialog's current media list</li>
					<li>the buttons on the manage tags dialog action popup dialog will now only show a max of 25 rows on their tooltips</li>
					<li>some larger->smaller selection events on large pages with many tags should be significantly faster</li>
					<li>subscription popups should now 'blank' their network job controls when not working (rather than leaving them on the old job, and without flickery-ly removing the job control completely)</li>
					<li>the file cache and gallery log summary controls now have ... ellipsized texts to reduce their max width</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where larger 'overriding bandwidth' status wait times would sometimes show instead of legit regular smaller bandwidth wait times</li>
					<li>removed a now-superfluous layer of buffering in the thumbnail grid drawing pipeline--it seems to have removed some slight lag/flicker</li>
					<li>I may have fixed the issue where a handful of thumbs will sometimes remain undrawn after several fast scrolling events</li>
					<li>gave the some-linux-flavours infinitely-expanding popup message problem another pass. there _should_ be an explicit reasonable max width on the thing now</li>
					<li>added a 'html5lib not found!' notification to the network->downloaders menu if this library is missing (mostly for users running from source)</li>
					<li>help->about now states if lz4 is present</li>
					<li>gave 'running from source' help page another pass, including info on running a virtual environment</li>
					<li>in file lookup scripts, the full file content now supports string transformations--if this is set to occur, the file will be sent as an addition POST parameter and the content-type set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. this is a temp fix to see if we can get whatanime.ga working, and may see some more work</li>
					<li>if the free space on the db dir partition is < 500MB, the program will not boot</li>
					<li>if the free space on the db dir partition is < 1GB, the client will not sync repositories</li>
					<li>on boot the client can now attempt to auto-heal a missing local_hashes table. it will give an appropriate error message</li>
					<li>misc post-importing-cleanup refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 317</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>completely overhauled the tag filter panel:</li>
					<li>the tag filter panel now has 'whitelist' and 'blacklist' pages beside the old 'advanced' sub-panel. these new simple pages are much more human friendly for common workflows and provide easy-select checkboxes for namespace classes (which are compiled from all the namespaces your parsers can currently do)</li>
					<li>the tag filter rule entering workflow now stops you from creating overcomplicated rulesets: when adding a blacklist rule, it will now only add an explicit entry if it is not already blocked by a higher rule (otherwise it will just discard from whitelist, if there)--and when adding a whitelist rule, it will now only add an explicit entry if it is already blocked by a higher blacklist rule (otherwise it will just discard from blacklist, if there)</li>
					<li>tag filters now provide more human-friendly summary statements</li>
					<li>misc improvements to tag filter ui logic</li>
					<li>the various help texts surrounding the tag filter panel all got passes</li>
					<li>the tag filter panel now uses text-and-paste controls for mass-adding of tags</li>
					<li>namespace checkboxes have been completely removed from the tag import options panel and various other related places. any existing TIO with checked namespaces will be automatically updated to 'get tags' with an appropriate filter. this is an important step in the rewrite--everything is now handled in the new tag filter panel</li>
					<li>simplified and sped up the actual tag filtering code</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>numerous multi-importer improvements:</li>
					<li>the gallery and watcher page lists will now ~dynamically~ resize in height based on number of entries, from roughly four columns to twenty four. this relayout code somehow seems to work on all platforms</li>
					<li>sped up the 'results loading' step of gallery/watcher highlighting immensely--on a typical list of a couple hundred files, it should now be about 50ms total (before, depending on presentation rules, it could be 0.8-3s)</li>
					<li>added an additional db-skipping optimisation for calculating presentation status</li>
					<li>watcher and gallery highlights will now filter out trash and completely deleted files (the ones that appear with a dark default 'hydrus' icon) on reloads</li>
					<li>added two checkboxes to options->downloading for 'if nothing is highlighted when I add a new X, highlight that new X' for watchers and galleries</li>
					<li>adding or removing a query or watcher from the new multi-lists should now be reflected in the list ui instantly, rather than after a <=1s delay</li>
					<li>added url classes and parsers for imgur single and multiple urls--thanks to the community for providing some examples</li>
					<li>added url class and parser for derpibooru single file pages--again thanks to the community. derpibooru hence now supports basic drag and drop import</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the watcher was often still checking despite 404 status</li>
					<li>watchers and galleries use a little less CPU to update some of their ui</li>
					<li>added simple subsidiary page parsing support to file import objects (previously, this only worked in the gallery log)</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>gave the thumbnail scrolling code a pass--it is now a bit cleverer about drawing and uses a larger number of smaller 'tile' bmps rather than pages</li>
					<li>added an 'EXPERIMENTAL' option to options->gui to change the number of thumbnails each scroll tick scrolls. it defaults to 1.0, but you _should_ be able to set 0.5, 0.37, whatever. please report any bugs!</li>
					<li>added a thumbnail debug mode to help see the new thumbnail layout boundaries</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc:</li>
					<li>the max subscription file limits are now 10,000 for users in advanced mode</li>
					<li>the default subs initial/periodic limit is now 100/100 (bumped up from 100/50)</li>
					<li>the file import dialog now has a little cog icon to change whether human sort is applied on path addition events (for e.g. if you want to add in some date order from an explorer window)</li>
					<li>humansort now sorts case-insensitive</li>
					<li>by default, unmatched urls will no longer display in the top-right of the media viewer. see how you like this and let me know if you would like an option to put them back</li>
					<li>the speed text on the right-side of the network job control now dynamically resizes to its min size, which gives the text on the left side (where it is often cut off, saying 'overriding bandwidth ...') more space when available</li>
					<li>I think I fixed an issue where the popup frame could spam-resize in odd ways (such as growing a pixel wider every update tick)</li>
					<li>watchers will no longer include the '* ' highlight prefix in subject-based sort comparisons</li>
					<li>in prep for an eventual major code refactoring, the thumbnails' underlying media object now stores a faster db-based numeric file identifier</li>
					<li>'duplicate' calls on the new listctrl will now insert the dupes in the current correct sort location, rather than tacking them on the end</li>
					<li>drag and drop imports to the new listctrl will also now insert like this</li>
					<li>caught up edit subscriptions panel to the finalised common listctrl panel code, including the import/export/duplicate buttons</li>
					<li>the multiple checkboxlist selection dialog now sorts by label</li>
					<li>converted all old checkboxlist dialogs to the new panel system</li>
					<li>massively sped up certain kinds of parsing that were wasting time hitting a cache test way too often</li>
					<li>fixed an old hash filtering system</li>
					<li>moved to a simpler and more stable way of calculating certain text extents</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the include directory (which has the original source, which isn't a big deal but is nice to have) wasn't being correctly copied into the linux build</li>
					<li>the os x .tar.gz build now has the include directory</li>
					<li>refactored some client tags code around</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 316</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>gallery:</li>
					<li>gallery url classes can now be linked to parsers!</li>
					<li>if parsers are linked, gallery pagewalk can now work on the new parsing system. gallery import pipeline has been significantly updated to reflect this</li>
					<li>gallery import objects are now 'multiple' gallery imports, much like the multi-watcher, with each separate query having its own entry in a list (they also run in parallel!)</li>
					<li>the multi-gallery list will show file/gallery pause status in slender columns, and will show a 'stop' character when gallery parsing is done</li>
					<li>wrote a 'gallery selector' button and added it to the new multi-gallery page, so you can spawn queries for ~different sites~ on the same import page! it always defaults to 'deviant art' for now, but when the next 'searcher' overhaul step is done, this will be customisable</li>
					<li>the new page selector and related 'pages' menu is now simpler--with the new selector, you just select 'gallery'</li>
					<li>added 'new_gallery_downloader_page' shortcut action to the 'main gui' set to allow quick opening of this new page type</li>
					<li>wrote a 'gallery import panel', which reviews a single gallery import stream, and added it to the multi-gallery page to show the current highlighted query</li>
					<li>as all gallery imports now run in parallel and work on the new system, the now almost-useless 'cancel' gallery pagewalk button is now removed</li>
					<li>with the wider availability of the new gallery log for file count and error reports, shifted around and smoothed out some gallery status text presentation</li>
					<li>improved the auto url_class->parser linking 'try to fill in gaps' logic to work with gallery urls (this was surprisingly complicated)</li>
					<li>fixed a misc stupid waste of time in auto url_class->parser linking</li>
					<li>many misc updates to gallery pipeline</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>subscriptions:</li>
					<li>wrote a new gallery pagewalk pipeline for subscriptions, which still does oldest-to-newest url addition and obeys file limits and so on</li>
					<li>numerous subscription pipeline and error handling tweaks and improvements, particularly in regards to the new code</li>
					<li>subscriptions now have max initial and periodic file limits of 1000. existing subs with >1000 or infinite will be cut to 1000. there is a help button on the edit sub panel to explain why you should do large syncs with the manual downloader and not subs</li>
					<li>the ugly and dangerous-if-you-scroll-in-the-wrong-place gallery selector mismash control in the edit subscription panel is now replaced with the new gallery selector button</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the edit subs panels could sometimes say '48 years ago' (i.e. displaying a literal time delta since 0, 1970) on initial timestamps</li>
					<li>juggled some 'periodic limit' reporting logic to skip an unusual false positive that affect hentai foundry subs for now and more in future</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>urls:</li>
					<li>the url downloader now accepts gallery urls and will receive drag-and-dropped gallery urls. at the moment, it only parses the one page (i.e. it doesn't start a new 'searching' pagewalk) and sends the parsed links to its file queue</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>watcher:</li>
					<li>finished 'watcher panel', which reviews a watcher, and added it to the multi-watcher page to show the current highlighted watcher</li>
					<li>the single watcher page is completely removed--it is only the multiple watcher now. all singles will be converted to multiples on update</li>
					<li>some single-watcher options (like watchers naming their own page tabs and the [404]-style page name prefixes) are removed</li>
					<li>multiple watcher panel now lists file/checking pause status and has separate buttons to control these paused statuses</li>
					<li>fixed some misc watcher highlight code--highlighted watchers should correctly publish to the page from the start of session load now</li>
					<li>improved some 'repage' logic in how highlighted threads get removed</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>misc:</li>
					<li>discovered a scroll-setup parameter that stops janky scroll-to-click-focus behaviour on all the new scrolling panels, thank the LORD</li>
					<li>improved some 'can't parse' error handling for post url parsing</li>
					<li>reworked how all importers present their network jobs to the ui, including fast response if the switch happens during a job</li>
					<li>in prep for searcher switchover where all downloader sources will be harmonised into one system, booru identifiers now present in several ui locations as 'name', not 'booru: name'</li>
					<li>updated the danbooru parser to deal with the new 'next page' markup they use</li>
					<li>wrote a gelbooru gallery parser that works with 0.2.0 and 0.2.5 gelb sites--an ancillary issue where gelb-related downloaders could sometimes not accurately figure out the magic '42' next-page offset is hence now fixed</li>
					<li>wrote an e621 gallery page parser</li>
					<li>these sites hence now support single-page gallery drag-and-drop</li>
					<li>added url classes for artstation gallery url and its api counterpart, but didn't go further yet--we aren't quite there with api pagewalking just yet</li>
					<li>updated deviant art gallery url classes</li>
					<li>added an e621 'search initialisation' gallery url class to improve some future drag-and-drop stuff</li>
					<li>url normalisation no longer cuts off 'www.'-style prefixes</li>
					<li>url comparison is more careful to test 'www.'-style prefixes, so a file import cache should recognise that 'http://www.blah.com/blah' is the same as 'https://blah.com/blah'</li>
					<li>did a bunch of refactoring to further split up the bloated ClientImporting.py</li>
					<li>fixed some misc downloader layout that may have been hiding some texts previously</li>
					<li>some multi-watcher and multi-gallery events like add/pause query should be a bit snappier</li>
					<li>in the parsing ui, url and title priorities are now 50 by default</li>
					<li>prepped a little subscription unit test code for when searcher object is done</li>
					<li>misc downloader layout improvements</li>
					<li>misc listctrl refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 315</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>got started on the big gallery update, but decided not to pull the trigger just yet. I hope to do it next week, switching the whole thing over to a two-object multi-watcher kind of deal</li>
					<li>updated to wxPython 4.0.3 for all platforms</li>
					<li>cleaned up some menubar replacement code, and the update to the new wxPython should also fix a "event for a menu without associated window" bug some gtk2 users were seeing on quick menubar changes</li>
					<li>manage default tag import options panel now has copy/paste buttons that work on the listctrl</li>
					<li>added some 'paste tag import options' safety code to make sure no one accidentally pastes a subscription or something in there, wew</li>
					<li>added default checker options for subscriptions to options->downloading</li>
					<li>unified how checker options are edited from their button, much like how file and tag import options work. it also has a summary tooltip on the button</li>
					<li>the checker options under options->downloading are now these slimmer buttons</li>
					<li>in the manual import dialog (which pops up when you drop a folder/files on the client), the files will now be added in 'human friendly' number sorting, so files of the sort 'Favourites - 10.jpg' will sort [10, 11, ..., 99, 100] rather than the purely lexicographic [10, 100, 11, ..., 99]</li>
					<li>gave the migrate database dialog a pass--a bunch of misc presentation changes and a general simplification of workflow, now based more on just increase/decrease location weight</li>
					<li>a bunch of texts on page management (left-hand) panels that share horizontal space with buttons should now ellipsize ("downlo...") when they get too long for the width instead of drawing in an ugly way over the buttonspace</li>
					<li>moved the manage import folders dialog to the new listctrl and added a 'paused' and better 'check period' column</li>
					<li>if a user tries to run a 'paused' import folder specifically from the menu, the import folder will now unpause (I will probably remove this old paused variable in the future--it isn't of much use any more)</li>
					<li>tightened up some repository reset code that wasn't deleting all service tables and hence recovering from some service id malformation errors correctly</li>
					<li>wrote a 'clear orphan tables' db maintenance routine that kills some spare tables some users who have previously deleted/reset repositories may have floating around</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with parsing folders after hitting cancel button on the import files pre-dialog</li>
					<li>if watchers encounter non-404 network errors during check, they should now just delay checking for four hours (before, they were also pausing checking completely)</li>
					<li>if watchers are in 'delay' mode, they'll also not work on files.</li>
					<li>file and gallery downloads that hit a 403 (Forbidden) will now present a simpler error status, like they do for 404</li>
					<li>the new post downloader will no longer fail if one of the parsed source urls is not a url. the borked string will also not be associated as a url</li>
					<li>regular gallery downloads now override bandwidth for the file download step, which is almost always the second half of a pair of post_url/file downloads, just to keep things in sync in edge cases</li>
					<li>cleaned up some timestamp generation and 'overriding in x seconds' strings to be more human friendly</li>
					<li>improved some serverside file parse error handling to propagate the actual error description up to the client a bit better</li>
					<li>fixed typo causing incorrect num_ignored count in file import status button right-click menu</li>
					<li>parseexceptions will now present more data about which page and content parser caused the problem. I am not totally happy about how this solution works and may revisit it</li>
					<li>the lz4 import error catching is now more broad to catch some odd problem I discovered in new Linux build environment</li>
					<li>the moebooru parser now fetches the original png of an image, if available</li>
					<li>added a new tumblr parser that also gets post tags--it _shouldn't_ be the default</li>
					<li>the new login pipeline now kicks in for the legacy logins--pixiv and hentai foundry--on a per-url basis, so adding pixiv/hf urls to the url downloader will trigger a login even if needed (previously, this was tied to legacy gallery initialisation, which explains some pixiv 'missing' login stuff some users and I were having trouble with)</li>
					<li>if the legacy login system fails in the new pipeline, it now sets a flag and won't try again that client boot</li>
					<li>the old 'default tag import options' panel is now completely removed from options->importing. please check 'network->downloaders->manage default tag import options' for the new url-based settings</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 314</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>tag import options can now be set to 'default', meaning 'use whatever the default is at the time of import', which will be an easier way of managing TIOs for many subs that you'd prefer all share the same TIO settings anyway</li>
					<li>updated tag import options ui to enable this default setting where appropriate</li>
					<li>updated the newer import pipeline to work with 'default'-set tag import options</li>
					<li>new downloaders, subscriptions, watchers, and multi-watchers now start with 'default' tag import options</li>
					<li>deleted the old default tag import options management code and put some text up on options->importing making notice about the impending shift. a popup message will also say this on update</li>
					<li>tag import options buttons now have a right-click menu with copy/paste/default options for quick assignment and duplication!</li>
					<li>added 'overwrite tag import options' to manage subscriptions--once you are comfortable with the new 'default' TIO mode, and after some small tests, you might want to switch all your subs over to 'default'</li>
					<li>the 'urls' downloader now has a tag import options--it initialises as 'default'</li>
					<li>added furry.booru.org to gelbooru 0.2.0 parser</li>
					<li>wrote a hentai foundry file page parser</li>
					<li>wrote a moebooru file page parser (this works for konachan, yande.re, and sakugabooru)</li>
					<li>wrote a shimmie parser (this works for rule34.paheal, rule34hentai, and mishimmie)</li>
					<li>wrote a newgrounds parser</li>
					<li>integrated the user-created sankaku parser</li>
					<li>wrote a tumblr parser that handles photo, photoset, and video posts, auto-converts to 'raw' urls for those post-2012 urls that can handle it, figures out a creator tag (reverting to the reblog root if it is a reblog post!), and cooks you breakfast</li>
					<li>(hence all these above sites now support drag and drop!)</li>
					<li>rolled out some new tumblr url classes to handle all this.</li>
					<li>added sakugabooru url classes</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where url classes were not normalising api urls in all cases, meaning some url classes would not api-link correctly in 'manage url class links' panel</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with deviant art legacy gallery parser pulling some funky 'creator:' tags</li>
					<li>some misc new downloader error handling improvements</li>
					<li>the watcher now uses the new gallery object to parse and generate file import objects</li>
					<li>the downloaders with gallery logs should now report non-success gallery fetches, along with error tracebacks (this will include some no-worry 404s the legacy downloader sometimes uses to terminate searches)</li>
					<li>added image and thumbnail cache timeout time delta buttons to options->speed and memory</li>
					<li>added a 'show the D on short file import summaries' checkbox to options->downloading--it defaults to off</li>
					<li>the 'I' on short file import summaries is now 'Ig' to clear up 1/I confusion</li>
					<li>added 'copy queries' to the edit subscription panel, which lets you copy all the selected queries' search texts to clipboard, newline separated</li>
					<li>added a checkbox to options->gui that commands 'last session' only be autosaved during idle time. this is useful if you usually have a huge (200k+ file) session and your client is always on</li>
					<li>fixed file import status button right-click, which I messed up somehow last week with the 'retry ignored' add</li>
					<li>shook up and collapsed the network menu into neater categories</li>
					<li>tightened-up the rarely used pre-parsing conversion panel on the edit page parser panel to just a button with a bit of explaining text</li>
					<li>if database errors include the word 'malformed', the client now throws a little extra error text pointing people to the help.txt in the db dir</li>
					<li>cleared out some legacy download code</li>
					<li>cleared out legacy hard drive import error handling, moving it all to the new file import object</li>
					<li>misc refactoring and cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 313</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fleshed out the new gallery log and its constituent log entry objects</li>
					<li>added gallery logs to gallery downloaders, subscriptions, url downloaders, simple downloaders and watchers</li>
					<li>added very simple gallery log reporting to these downloaders</li>
					<li>added first, read-only version of gallery log ui to these downloaders</li>
					<li>fleshed out some new gallery/file-object pipeline stuff</li>
					<li>wrote a simple danbooru gallery page parser and added it on update. it doesn't do anything yet, but if you are into the new parsing system, please check it out as an example</li>
					<li>the url downloader now has a full file import status control with status text</li>
					<li>fixed a url count issue on completely fresh gallery downloads that was stopping gallery searches one file (like 199 vs 200) before the file limit</li>
					<li>the pixiv downloader now fetches 'type=all' gallery pages, which include specifically manga file pages (as opposed to merely multi-file 'illustrations')</li>
					<li>added 'retry ignored' to the file import status button's right-click menu</li>
					<li>fixed the deviant art url class and parser to use the new file page format. also added an '(old format)' class to match the old way for legacy purposes (this legacy class also uses an api conversion to connect to the new parser--we'll also figure out a way to convert all these over at the db level en masse later!)</li>
					<li>updated some similar deviant art gallery stuff as well</li>
					<li>tag import options now has a tag filter to go along with the 'get all tags' checkbox! ('get all tags' is now renamed to 'get all' as a result). this filter lets you make more complicated tag filtering decisions like 'get all tags except "species:" tags'.</li>
					<li>the new 'only get tags if they already exist' checkbox now also has a filter, if you want to only apply this test to a subset of tags (like the unwashed mess of unnamespaced tags many boorus and sites provide)</li>
					<li>generalised a 'tag filter' button class to make it simpler to edit tag filters across the program, and cleaned up some related status code</li>
					<li>fixed a problem with deriving tag import options for specific url classes when that url class was part of an api-url-class chain</li>
					<li>if the domain manager cannot now find a url match for a pending download, it now assigns the file post default tag import options to that import</li>
					<li>added a new 'duplicates' options page that has a hacky way to edit the weighted scores used to determine which of the pair of files to present file in the duplicates filter</li>
					<li>unifed how some file import status generation works, adding a new 'simple status' string to briefly summarise progress in multi-watcher and edit subscriptions columns</li>
					<li>cleared out some old redundant status caching in the urls downloader</li>
					<li>simplified how almost all timestamp strings are generated</li>
					<li>simplified how time delta strings are generated</li>
					<li>brushed up some simple common ways to present timestamps as 'human pretty' strings</li>
					<li>all places where timestamps would be presented as a mix of '5 days ago' and complete datetime strings will now present as '5 days ago' unless you set the new options->gui 'always show iso' checkbox. going back to simple to clear up confusion in workflow and code. I may revisit this, as turning on ISO mode now spams it all over the place</li>
					<li>cleaned up the 'looks like the computer just woke from sleep' check and reduced its grace period to fifteen seconds. foreground daemons (like the subscription daemon) and the network engine will now also obey it</li>
					<li>added a 'simulate wake from sleep' debug action to better test the sleep-wake detection code</li>
					<li>improved my custom statictext class to auto-wrap text without flickering</li>
					<li>used this new autowrapping to improve wrapping and layout of popup message texts</li>
					<li>replaced all other st wrapping with this new code</li>
					<li>wrote a little helper function to better dedupe lists in future</li>
					<li>did a bunch of refactoring to neaten some long common func names</li>
					<li>deleted some old unused code</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 312</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>converted much of the increasingly complicated tag import options to a new sub-object that simplifies a lot of code and makes things easier to serialise and update in future</li>
					<li>tag import options now allows you to set whether tags should be applied to new files/already in inbox/already in archive, much like the file import options' 'presentation' checkboxes</li>
					<li>tag import options now allows you to set whether tags should be filtered to only those that already have a non-zero current count on that tag service (i.e. only tags that 'already exist')</li>
					<li>tag import options now has two 'fetch if already in db' checkboxes--for url and hash matches separately (the hash stuff is advanced, but this new distinction will be of increasing use in the future)</li>
					<li>tag import options now applies sibling and parent collapse/expansion before tag filtering, which will improve filtering accuracy (so if you only want creator tags, and a sibling would convert an unnamespaced tag up to a creator, you will now get it)</li>
					<li>the old 'all namespaces' checkbox is now removed from some 'defaults' areas, and any default tag import options that had it checked will instead get 'get all' checked as they update</li>
					<li>caught up the ui and importer code to deal with these tag import option changes</li>
					<li>improved how some 'should download metadata/file' pre-import checking works</li>
					<li>moved all complicated 'let's derive some specific tag import options from these defaults' code to the tag import options object itself</li>
					<li>wrote some decent unit tests for tag import options</li>
					<li>wrote a parser for deviant art. it has source time now, and falls back to the embedded image if the artist has disabled high-res downloading. if it finds a mature content click-through (due to not being logged in), it will now veto and set 'ignored' status (we will revisit this and get high quality nsfw from DA when the login manager works.)</li>
					<li>if a check timings object (like for a subscription or watcher) has a 'static' check interval, it will now apply that period to the 'last next check time', so if you set it to check every seven days, starting on Wednesday night, it will now repeatedly check on Wed night, not creep forward a few minutes/hours every time due to applying time to the 'last check completed time'. if you were hit by this, hit 'check now' to reset your next check time to now</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher now sorts by status by default, and blank status now sorts below DEAD and the others, so you should get a neat subject-alphabetical sort grouped by interesting-status-first now right from the start</li>
					<li>added 'clear all multiwatcher highlights' to 'pages' menu</li>
					<li>fixed a typo bug in the new multiple watcher options-setting buttons</li>
					<li>added 'retry ignored' buttons to edit subscription/subscriptions panels, so you can retry pixiv manga pages en masse</li>
					<li>added 'always show iso time' checkbox to options->gui, which will stop replacing some recent timestamps with '5 minutes ago'</li>
					<li>fixed an index-selection issue with compound formulae in the new parsing system</li>
					<li>fixed a file progress count status error in subscriptions that was reducing progress rather than increasing range when the post urls created new urls</li>
					<li>improved error handling when a file import object's index can't be figured out in the file import list</li>
					<li>to clear up confusion, the crash recovery dialog now puts the name of the default session it would like to try loading on its ok button</li>
					<li>the new listctrl class will now always sort strings in a case-insensitive way</li>
					<li>wrote a simple 'fetch a url' debug routine for the help->debug menu that will help better diagnose various parse and login issues in future</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the autocomplete dropdown float window could sometimes get stuck in 'show float' mode when it spawned a new window while having focus (usually due to activating/right-clicking a tag in the list and hitting 'show in new page'). any other instances of the dropdown getting stuck on should now also be fixable/fixed with a simple page change</li>
					<li>improved how some checkbox menu data is handled</li>
					<li>started work on a gallery log, which will record and action gallery urls in the new system much like the file import status area</li>
					<li>significant refactoring of file import objects--there are now 'file seeds' and 'gallery seeds'</li>
					<li>added an interesting new 'alterate' duplicate example to duplicates help</li>
					<li>brushed off and added some more examples to duplicates help, thanks to users for the contributions</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 311</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote a new parser that muddles its way through pixiv's new dynamic javascript layout. it seems to get everything working again. it gets tags in kanji, although the unnamespaced pixiv tags remain low quality, and you may wish to just not parse them at all anyway</li>
					<li>fixed some misc parser text handling, unicode conversion etc...</li>
					<li>the new pixiv parser has a 'page' tag stub that should inform tag import options in the old downloader</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher now remembers the highlighted watcher through a session restart</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher now shows the highlighted watcher's url up top</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher now has checker, file import, and tag import options, which it will assign to all new watchers it creates</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher now has a 'set options to watchers' button that will force-set the current options to all the selected watchers</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher now has an 'added' column with watcher creation time listed. storing this creation time is new, so any existing watchers will get a new creation time of their next load time, but it is remembered henceforth. the listctrl here is now pretty crushed for width, so maybe we'll rejigger some stuff here</li>
					<li>watchers added to a multiple watcher will now have a status of 'just added' for five seconds</li>
					<li>watchers that are added to a multiple watcher that is already watching them will now have the status of 'already watching' for five seconds</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher list now has a much taller minimum height--layout here is another work in progress</li>
					<li>fixed the inkbunny parser (and a related tweak to the inkbunny url class)--it now uses the new 'multiple-file-per-post' import object generation to actually walk through the pages of the mini-gallery (which for inkbunny have -p2- suffixes on the url) to fetch only the correct files and url-associate them neatly</li>
					<li>tag import options now has a 'get all tags' checkbox, which can override the normal namespace checkboxes. it gets all tags, even those with namespaces not listed, which happens for several reasons in the new download system. (eventually, the namespace list may be replaced with a slightly different system)</li>
					<li>watcher tag import options no longer list 'filename' under their namespace checkboxes--they just have this 'get all tags', which works for everything (so watching yiff.party pages should now get tags)</li>
					<li>simplified and sped up similar files search at the db level</li>
					<li>sped up some ratings search code</li>
					<li>generalised some common file search optimisations, meaning they now apply in more situations and can take advantage of some other speed-ups:</li>
					<li>similar files system predicate is now faster</li>
					<li>inclusive ratings searches are now faster</li>
					<li>duplicate relationship count searches with non-zero-inclusive count are now faster</li>
					<li>removed some clumsy old ratings search optimisation code</li>
					<li>exporting serialised objects as pngs is a bit easier--now, it displays current export path better, will remember the last export location used, and for single png exports will pre-fill the filename and 'title' value with a reasonable default</li>
					<li>the content parser, page parser, and url class listctrls now accept serialised png files when drag and dropped!</li>
					<li>the simple downloader should recover and continue better from malformed urls during a page parse</li>
					<li>the url downloader should now recover better from various situations where it cannot not derive some tag import options (including urls with a 'file' url class, such as 4ch/8ch direct file links)</li>
					<li>parse test results will now state the priority value of urls</li>
					<li>gave the 'updating' section of help a pass and wrote a little more on how to do a big-version-gap update</li>
					<li>when a new multi-file import object inserts its child file import objects while being looked at in the ui, the listctrl should now correctly refresh the displayed indices</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now wait up to 90s for bandwidth (was 30s before, I think) before quitting, which should avoid a few more early-quit events</li>
					<li>cleaned up some server decompression bomb testing</li>
					<li>users with admin-level accounts can now upload decompression bombs to file repositories, better options on this will be avaliable in future</li>
					<li>the manage urls dialog will now OK on the same 'manage_file_urls' shortcut action that can open it (like manage tags and ratings already do)</li>
					<li>fixed the string converter for new file lookup parsing scripts</li>
					<li>started work on some in-the-background mass file reparsing, but I want to get some nicer ui going before I pull the trigger on any of it</li>
					<li>file reparsing now repopulates the table for md5, sha1, and sha512 hashes if they are missing</li>
					<li>improved some ffmpeg error parsing</li>
					<li>moved from basic list to a pop-faster collections.deque for importable path parsing and duplicate search branch regen</li>
					<li>added a BUGFIX option to options->gui that forces minimum width for popup messages in the continuing attempt to deal with some funny fit/layout calculation in certain Linux WMs</li>
					<li>fixed how some 'unrepairable db' error messages are displayed in Linux systems</li>
					<li>cleaned up a ton of old tuple-stripping code from the db</li>
					<li>updated to new sqlite for windows build</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 310</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>updated the inkbunny file page url class to acknowledge that inbunny pages can have multiple files</li>
					<li>updated the inkbunny file page parser to handle multiple file urls (although they may be out of order and possibly sometimes include the artist profile image--this was not super easy)</li>
					<li>added a parser for twitter tweets (only images supported atm, but it can handle multiple!) (hence tweet drag and drop now works!)</li>
					<li>updated the artstation file page url class to redirect to a new api url class</li>
					<li>wrote an artstation file page parser that also handles multiple file urls</li>
					<li>updated/added pixiv file page, manga page, and mange_big url classes</li>
					<li>updated pixiv file page parsers to be ok with manga links</li>
					<li>wrote parsers for pixiv manga and manga_big pages to fetch manga files (with page tags)!</li>
					<li>file import objects can now create semi-duplicate children for multi-file post urls and insert them just after themselves in the file import queue.</li>
					<li>file import objects can now receive and remember referral urls. this referral url is associated with the file if appropriate. the watcher and simple downloader now uses this in addition to the multi-file post system</li>
					<li>jumbled around some parameters and merged the two new file import url commands (import 'file' vs import 'post') into one single simple 'work on this url, thanks' call that is now used across the program</li>
					<li>the parsing system's 'content parser' no longer fetches file urls and post urls, but 'download urls' and 'source urls'. this helps some pipeline logic and also lets post urls be download urls</li>
					<li>when file import objects parse post urls as the urls to download, it now creates 1-n new import objects, just like if multiple file urls.</li>
					<li>improved some file import object file association code</li>
					<li>the new parsing system will de-dupe parsed urls</li>
					<li>refactored the 'seed' code, which handles all basic file import objects, to the new ClientImportSeeds.py</li>
					<li>added a new string transformation type, 'integer addition', for shifting page number tags up and down</li>
					<li>fixed thumbnail generation for some videos that failed to do the new x%-in generation--it reverts more reliably just to the old frame 0 method</li>
					<li>file reparsing popup now has a stop button</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where extremely thin or wide (ratio > 200:1) images would not generate a full-size or resized thumbnail</li>
					<li>the file reparsing/re-thumbnailing now reports errors better (including with full path) and does not abandon the larger job as it works</li>
					<li>misc thumbnail generation code improvements</li>
					<li>improved some thumbnail and file regeneration/moving code when the existing file has read-only status</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher now has a 'check now' button</li>
					<li>added a checkbox to options->gui that will put new notebook page tabs on the left</li>
					<li>for all file download network jobs working in the new download system, the file import options for min size, max size, and max size (gifs) are now applied _during the download_! if the server tells the client the exact file size in the response headers, it will test max and min size before the content is actually downloaded--otherwise, it will test the max size as it downloads. if the server clearly says the file is a gif, the max gif size rules will also be tested in the same way</li>
					<li>cleaned up some bandwidth announcement code--now, if bandwidth is due in less time than override time, that will now correctly be the status text</li>
					<li>the bandwidth status no longer says 'in in' typo</li>
					<li>fixed up some tag repair code from last week</li>
					<li>the 'print garbage' debug function now dumps a whole bunch more data to the log</li>
					<li>the thumbnail cache should now be a bit more stoic about missing repository thumbnails--it should now just present the hydrus default backup without error popup spam</li>
					<li>the repository thumbnail sync will now get as thumbs in blocks as high as 10k at a time, rather than the old 100</li>
					<li>hydrus network requests no longer generate web domain network contexts (and so won't have a default one-request-per-second bandwidth limit and should stream through thumbnails a bit faster)</li>
					<li>hydrus network services are now willing to wait longer for bandwidth, so big thumbnail queues should keep working even if other bottlenecks pause them for a bit</li>
					<li>hydrus network services will no longer sometimes have double-sync popups if synced from the advanced 'sync now' button in review services</li>
					<li>changed the default global 'stop-accidents' bandwidth rule of 120rqs per minute to 512MB per minute. this only affects new users, but users trying to sync to large file repos might like to make a similar change manually</li>
					<li>doing giant full file delete (i.e. purge from trash) jobs should now be a bit gentler on the gui</li>
					<li>improved how the client deletes paths, clarifying in the code when and when not to allow recycle (usually disabled for thumb disposal)</li>
					<li>switched the hacky text widgets on the popup system to a newer object. seems to still render ok, so lets see if it fixes some unusual layout issues some users have seen</li>
					<li>if the temp folder cannot be created on boot, the client will continue anyway</li>
					<li>fixed some url-domain text handling in db storage that was also breaking v309 update for some users</li>
					<li>fixed some additional domain generation error handling at the db level</li>
					<li>the list of url classes in the system:url panel is now the list of all url classes that are considered associable (before, it was file and post urls)</li>
					<li>if a url class now api-links to itself or otherwise forms a loop with n other api url classes, the client will now throw an error (rather than lock up in an infinite loop!)</li>
					<li>in the parsing ui, tag parse test results are now cleaned before being displayed</li>
					<li>fixed misc url matching error reporting bug</li>
					<li>when consulting the current file limit, the gallery page downloader will now try, when it has that number, to consult the total number of urls found it the current search (old behaviour is to only consult the number of _new_ urls, which lead to some bad edge-case workflows)</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 309</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote a fix for the tumblr GDPR issue under _network->DEBUG: misc->do tumblr GDPR click-through_. you will also get a popup about this on update</li>
					<li>the tumblr downloader will try to detect the GDPR problem and present a similar popup guiding you to the GDPR click-through solution</li>
					<li>the client and server now generate video (but not gif yet) thumbnails 35% in by default. the client can now change this percentage value under options->media. this was highly requested and was being put off for a longer rewrite, but I figured out a simple way to hack it in. please let me know if you get failures</li>
					<li>on adding a parent, all files with the child tag will now also get all applicable grandparents (with no limit on recursive generations and dealing with accidental loops)</li>
					<li>on adding a sibling, all files with any of the siblings will now also get all applicable parents and grandparents for the whole group. a maintenance call to retroactively fill in the sibling/parent gaps that are now filled will also come soon</li>
					<li>this logic still does not apply in cross-service situations, which _will_ likely have to wait for a big data/gui overhaul and us figuring out what we actually want here</li>
					<li>added a simple pause/play button to the multiple watcher</li>
					<li>if the multiple watcher is set to catch watchable url drag and drop events and the current page is a multiple watcher, this current page will catch those new urls (as opposed to the _leftmost_ multiple watcher)</li>
					<li>improved some thread unpause logic which was failing to lock pause during 404 status</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher should now ignore case when it sorts by subject</li>
					<li>added url class and file page parser for inkbunny (so this site is now supported in drag and drop!). it fetches creator tag, some artist-made unnamespaced tags, source time, and md5</li>
					<li>added file page parser for gelbooru 0.2.0, which by default works for rule34.xxx, tbib, xbooru but certainly should work for a bunch of others. it fetches source time and source url</li>
					<li>html formula parsing rules can now additionally test the tag 'string' using a standard StringMatch object. this greatly helps to parse otherwise indistinguishable 'a' tags that have string 'Original image' and so on</li>
					<li>the 'have I seen this url's file before?' pre-import test is now much more strict and will cause fewer accidental false-positive 'already in db'/'deleted' results:</li>
					<li>the url pre-import test now does not trust source urls if they do not have a url class</li>
					<li>the url pre-import test now no longer trusts urls that are supposed to only be mapped to one file but are actually mapped to multiple</li>
					<li>this url pre-import test now treats url-classless original post urls and intended file urls with a special level of trust</li>
					<li>urls are now stored in the db in a more powerful and in-future easily searchable way--your db will take a moment to convert to the new format on update</li>
					<li>did some prep work for multi-file post urls (like pixiv manga) but did not have time to finish it</li>
					<li>the filename tagging options panel (in the 'add tags based on filename' of file import dialog and import folder dialog) now updates its tags/list 0.5s after the last change event, which means typing on a giant list will not cause megalag</li>
					<li>improved stability of some client-screen coordinate conversion</li>
					<li>misc bmp handling stability improvements</li>
					<li>improved some parsing ui stability when example data gets set after the dialog is closed</li>
					<li>improved some misc dialog close stability</li>
					<li>converted all but one final ui update timer to the new job scheduling system</li>
					<li>there are still problems with linux stability--I will continue to work on it</li>
					<li>an ugly (but basically harmless) shutdown exception sometimes caused by Animations being a bit slow on deleting their underlying bmps _should_ be fixed</li>
					<li>the export files dialog now generates its paths in sort order, meaning (1), (2) de-dupe filename suffixes should now be generated nicely in order</li>
					<li>the network domain manager should now always chase API URL links to get the right parser</li>
					<li>made some 'the db is broke, let's try to fix it' tag recovery code more forgiving</li>
					<li>misc improvements to some media indexing backend, which may fix some unusual session ghost files</li>
					<li>fixed the 'sure it is ok to close this importing page' dialog to also veto on a 'cancel' event, rather than just a 'no'</li>
					<li>added a guide to database_migration.html on how to move the db from just an HDD to straddle both an SSD and HDD.</li>
					<li>cleaned up the help->debug menu a bunch</li>
					<li>added run fast/slow memory maintenance calls to help->debug->data actions</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 308</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the multiple watcher will now discard new urls if it is already watching them</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher will list x/y progress as just 'x' if x==y (making it easier to scan the list)</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher now lists a couple of 'total' summary lines on its ui--the top lists total number of watchers and queue progress, the bottom lists the usual '23 successful, 3 deleted' line, but summed for all watchers</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher will now warn you if you try to remove the highlit, alive or un-caught-up watchers</li>
					<li>the multiple watcher will now resort if the thread subject (or rather, any data in the current sort column) changes (which usually happens right after it is added, when you see it change from from 'unknown subject' to 'mlp is kino')</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where multiple watchers were not unscheduling down their update job correctly on page close</li>
					<li>the booru selector in the edit subscription panel should now be in the tab traversal order for keyboard/automated focusing tasks</li>
					<li>the boorus in that selector are now alphabetised</li>
					<li>tag import options namespaces are now alphabetised</li>
					<li>removed/renamed pretty much all references to 'thread' in the watcher code and ui presentation, since it can now do a bunch of other stuff. it is now just the 'watcher' and the 'multiple watcher'</li>
					<li>deleted a bunch of old static thread watcher and page of images code from the old downloading system</li>
					<li>added an experimental 'compact' button to advanced mode users' manage subscriptions panels. this removes urls from the selected subscriptions' caches that are no longer useful, keeping their load/save snappy. this is still in testing--be careful with it!</li>
					<li>the hydrus splash screen now has a bare frame caption and will appear in the taskbar--which helps with some alt-tab and 'where the hell did it go?' stuff if you need to enter a password</li>
					<li>wrote five 'reasonable defaults' buttons for the 'check timings' options panel for quick entry for different thread/subscription scenarios.</li>
					<li>added a checkbox to this panel that will swap the reactive options with a simpler single checkbox</li>
					<li>also clarified/fleshed out the help button on this panel</li>
					<li>fixed an important source of program instability related to page alive/dead status checking that was inadvertantly talking subtly to the main gui frame even on non ui threads</li>
					<li>improved how some 'page is closed but not destroyed' test logic for pages inside a closed-but-not-destroyed notebook</li>
					<li>fixed another small place where the db was talking to the main gui object about status bar updates in a potentially unstable way</li>
					<li>fixed another small place where the foreground daemons were talking to the main gui frame in a trivial but potentially unstable way</li>
					<li>played around with some taglist sizer and layout settings</li>
					<li>the gallery and simple download pages are now a little shorter--the pause and cancel buttons are now just to the right of the status texts, rather than on their own row beneath the network job controls.</li>
					<li>the various bandwidth-overriding network jobs in the download system--like gallery page downloading--now wait 30s before overriding their bandwidth. hence these jobs will now obey the usual bandwidth rules up to a point</li>
					<li>the simple downloader also obeys the usual bandwidth rules for 30s but no longer has a static wait, so it can run much faster in certain situations</li>
					<li>network jobs that will override bandwidth in the future will now report that countdown in their status texts</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in the old booru code that meant some boorus were superfluously requesting the 0th indexed page of a gallery more frequently than needed in order to reestablish a 'page size' cache. this value is now cached globally and will be replaced by a completely different system in the new gallery downloader</li>
					<li>added a decent tooltip to the 'gallery fixed delay' widgets in the options->downloading panel</li>
					<li>the autocomplete input should clear itself after a 'broadcast' event a bit quicker and stop some dupe inputs in certain edge cases</li>
					<li>the tumblr url class now recognises that tumblr posts can have multiple files, which helps some source url lookup logic</li>
					<li>added a url class for artstation file pages</li>
					<li>the primary file import url (the one listed in the file import list) will now correctly not associate with the resulting file if its url class is so set</li>
					<li>all the import objects now have much lower idle CPU time and thread needs and start in slightly offset times, smoothing out the thread count spikes</li>
					<li>all the import objects will now respond quickly to changes to the underlying file import cache (like right-click->try again events)</li>
					<li>the new job scheduling system now uses two queues--fast and slow, in order to reduce some resort/insert overhead</li>
					<li>a couple more improvements to the new job scheduling system to smooth out spikes</li>
					<li>if the temporary path override does not exist, the client will now compain with spammy popup messages and fall back to the default</li>
					<li>if the temporary path override does not exist or is not writeable-to on options dialog ok, a veto exception will be raised</li>
					<li>refactored the watcher and multiple watcher to their own file, ClientImportWatchers</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 307</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote a gelbooru 0.2.5 (which matches gelbooru itself) parser in the new system. it now has some more redundancy and produces md5 hash and source urls</li>
					<li>fixed the e621 parser for flash files</li>
					<li>manage tags is now a notebook rather than a listbook!</li>
					<li>a problem where OS X was displaying the wrong label in the manage tags listbook is now fixed (as it no longer uses the buggy old listbook)</li>
					<li>improved autocomplete focus setting in OS X in general</li>
					<li>moved all paged importer loops to the new job scheduling system, which will massively cut down on idle time thread count (and some idle CPU usage) on clients with a bunch of import pages open</li>
					<li>the main thread pool (which the job scheduling system uses) can now temporarily grow much larger (200 threads) when it gets hammered</li>
					<li>recalibrated some thread watcher code to deal with being embedded in a larger object better (and sharing a page with other watcher importers)</li>
					<li>finished the first version of a multiple watcher. it is ugly and only for advanced users for now--please check release post for more information</li>
					<li>added 'use the multiple watcher on DnD events' to options->downloading, which will send thread url drag and drops straight to a new/existing multiple watcher!</li>
					<li>gui session load now 'shows' the first page but loads everything to the right in the background, which saves some CPU and memory for large sessions. this means it now starts focused on the leftmost page rather than the right--see if you like it or not</li>
					<li>'clear and load session' now fully deletes old pages and takes a little break between the clear and load step to make sure old large sessions are deleted tidily before loading the new stuff</li>
					<li>cleaned up the new leaner popup message display code to react better to (and re-layout) sub-changes in its popups (so now when a subscription popup spawns a new progress gauge, it _should_ be positioned in the right place immediately)</li>
					<li>if an import folder/subscription publishes files to a page while the main gui is minimised (and the action would result in a new page creation), the page add will be delayed until the gui is no longer minimised (new page layout in this case was broken due to minimised parent frame)</li>
					<li>the edit subscription query panel will now spawn with the query text input focused</li>
					<li>added a patch to ensure new booru import pages get query input focus after a second if the focus attempt on init failed (this will be fixed better in the new downloader system)</li>
					<li>restored the 'clear deleted files record' button to the 'combined local files' service on _review services_, which was previously hidden during a significant service rewrite.</li>
					<li>if critical master tables are missing on boot, the client will warn and provide info and then abandon the boot</li>
					<li>if cache similar files tables are missing on boot, the client will warn and provide info and offer to recreate them empty and try to boot the client anyway (this replaces some old repair code that wasn't always kicking in at a good time)</li>
					<li>if cache autocomplete tables are missing on boot, the client will warn and provide info and offer to recreate and repopulate them</li>
					<li>if mappings tables are missing on boot, the client will warn and provide info and offer to recreate them empty and try to boot the client anyway</li>
					<li>the emergency 'repair missing file locations' panel now runs in a more stable way</li>
					<li>this emergency dialog will now also recognise 'I fixed all the file paths but cannot do the thumbnail paths' situations and will present the same 'ok, make sure you run regen thumbs after boot' dialog as if all the missing paths were thumbnail related</li>
					<li>you can now turn off x/y page name import progress under options->gui</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where tags that begin with ':' like ':p' were not getting through the new importing system</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where tags that begin with ':' like ':p' could sometimes get prepended extra escape characters and end up looking like ':::p'</li>
					<li>fixed sibling tag searching (e.g. if a->b exists and you search for b, results with a but not b should also appear), which the recent tag search optimisation accidentally disabled</li>
					<li>whole bunch of refactoring and cleanup of ClientData and ClientGUICommon</li>
					<li>cleaned up some spammy splash text status setting that was flooding some debug info with useless garbage</li>
					<li>gave getting_started_tags.html's tag repo section and access_keys.html a pass, updating the ancient screenshot and linking advanced users to the latest QuickSync location</li>
					<li>some misc help updates</li>
					<li>misc autocomplete logic improvements</li>
					<li>misc ui display fixes</li>
					<li>misc wx destroy code stability improvement</li>
					<li>updated ffmpeg for windows builds to the new 4.0 release</li>
					<li>updated sqlite for windows builds</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 306</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the file import status list now has 'open selected import files in a new page', which should show up where it is possible. this is a bit prototype and ugly--it'll show _all_ files, including in-trash and permanently deleted (which will show up with the hydrus thumbnail)</li>
					<li>the file import status list now prefixes the already in db/deleted notes with 'url' or the hash type that lead to the recognition</li>
					<li>these redundant/deleted notes now also propagate up from 'during import' recognition phase as well</li>
					<li>the 'delete seeds of type x' entries on the file import status button's right-click menu are now split into three smaller individual tyes and are more explicit about exactly which status types they will remove</li>
					<li>like import folders, subscriptions can now optionally publish their files to pages as well as popup buttons. also, subscriptions can optionally publish their files separately for each query instead of all merged together</li>
					<li>sped up multiple tag queries significantly</li>
					<li>sped up simple (file size, mime, etc...) system predicate queries that also include a tag/namespace/wildcard predicate significantly</li>
					<li>added a pixiv parser that pulls the japanese tags to the defaults--users can switch to this if they prefer under network->manage url class links</li>
					<li>fixed the 4chan parser to get part of comment as backup subject/page title</li>
					<li>removed the 'newgrounds' entry from the normal gallery page creation ui, as the basic gallery parser no longer works due to a dynamic loading change on their end. I hope to have it back with the new gallery parsing system I will soon be writing</li>
					<li>the edit url classes panel now has a little text box to put in example urls and see which class, if any, that they match to</li>
					<li>improved layout of edit url class links panel</li>
					<li>all url types are now displayable in the media viewer--only post url classes are default on</li>
					<li>the new (x/y) import page page_name progress count is now updated on all alterations to this value (previously, this was not updating when a user interacted with the import queue, only when the natural downloader loop cycled)</li>
					<li>added 'can produce multiple files' option to post url url classes, which informs client url-checking logic whether the url can be relied upon for 'already in db/deleted' calculations</li>
					<li>the pixiv file page url class now has 'can produce multiple files' checked, meaning some bad pixiv url association logic due to other sites referencing it as a source url is now fixed</li>
					<li>added a 'twitter tweet' url class, which is also a 'can produce multiple files' post url</li>
					<li>added a 'sync known urls?' action choice to the duplicate merge options panel, which governs whether urls should be copied from worse to better or in both directions</li>
					<li>gave the edit duplicate merge options panel a layout pass</li>
					<li>the edit duplicate merge options panel will now disable pointless/over-complicated choices on non-custom actions, let me know if this is a pain for your workflow</li>
					<li>added a 'manual' web browser path override to the 'files and trash' options panel, which fixes the new share->open->in web browser option for Windows and also fixes some #anchor link propagation</li>
					<li>consolidated all URL/Path web browser launching code to one location</li>
					<li>'open in web browser' is now available for non-advanced_mode users and the 'open' submenu of the share menu is available in the preview window and the media viewer</li>
					<li>fixed a bug that was causing import folders to publish incorrect file identifiers, which was poisoning popup buttons and import page destinations</li>
					<li>gui sessions that fail to load a page will recover and continue to attempt loading the rest of their pages. some popups detailing the page's serialised data and error will be presented</li>
					<li>gui sessions that fail to save a page will recover and continue to attempt saving the rest of their pages. some popups detailsing the page's rough info and error will be presented</li>
					<li>the core controller inside all media pages will now present itself in a more beautiful way when asked to dump itself to a log (which should beautify the above save error a bit)</li>
					<li>wrote a subsidiary database->check->just repo update files that tests integrity of only repository update files</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where default tag import options were sometimes not being saved from the new dialog in the networking menu</li>
					<li>wrote a couple of layers of bad tag protection to help the new downloader deal with some occasional bad output from the old downloader</li>
					<li>network jobs can now reattempt connection attempts up to three times on POST requests (if you ever got inexplicable immediate 'could not connect' errors on repository uploads, this should now be fixed)</li>
					<li>replaced some archaic misc old import code with the new system, cleaning up a bunch of stuff and making space for further refactoring along the way</li>
					<li>fixed tags blacklist not being inherited in the old (through options dialog) system</li>
					<li>improved some invalid domain error handling</li>
					<li>fixed an animation update issue that would pause naturally updating controls on non-main-gui  frames when there were no regular media pages open on the main gui</li>
					<li>added a BUGFIX option to 'files and trash' option page to override the default temp path for almost all client temp path requests</li>
					<li>the minimum value for the 'vacuum period' in maintenance and processing options is now 28 days. the control also has a little explanatory tooltip</li>
					<li>the 'try to auto-link url classes and parsers' function now always preferences parsers alphabetically</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in the string transformations prettyfication code that incorrectly summarised 'take the last x characters' as the opposite</li>
					<li>misc fix to file hash generation and status checking code</li>
					<li>the 'export tags to .txt files' checkbox on the export files panel will no longer bother you with a dialog as you uncheck it</li>
					<li>wrote some code to make it easier and more fool-proof to update the domain manager with new url classes and parsers on my end</li>
					<li>improved some popup message manager ok-to-alter-ui logic when the main ui is minimised and so on</li>
					<li>fixed some potential crash conditions (affecting linux mostly, seems like) in the service credential testing and access key fetching ui code</li>
					<li>fixed a bug when 'stopping' a gallery parse during a long error pause (like when it holds on '404')</li>
					<li>sped up some old set intersection code</li>
					<li>some import file presentation refactoring</li>
					<li>some url content application pipeline cleanup</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 305</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed the pixiv url class, which was unintentionally removing a parameter</li>
					<li>wrote a pixiv parser in the new system, fixing a whole bunch of tag parsing along the way, and also parses 'source time'! by default, pixiv now fetches the translated/romaji versions of tags</li>
					<li>finished a safebooru parser that also handles source time and source urls</li>
					<li>finished an e621 parser that also handles source time and source urls and hash!</li>
					<li>wrote a danbooru parser that also handles source time and source urls and hash!</li>
					<li>as a result, danbooru, safebooru, e621, and pixiv post urls are now drag-and-droppable onto the client!</li>
					<li>finished up a full yiff.party watcher from another contribution by @cuddlebear on the discord, including url classes and a full parser, meaning yiff.party artist urls are now droppable onto the client and will spawn thread watchers (I expect to add some kind of subscription support for watchers in the future). inline links are supported, and there is source time and limited filename: and hash parsing</li>
					<li>fixed some thread watcher tag association problems in the new system</li>
					<li>when pages put an (x) number after their name for number of files, they will now also put an (x/y) import total (if appropriate and not complete) as well. this also sums up through page of pages!</li>
					<li>if a call to close a page of pages or the application would present more than one page's 'I am still importing' complaint, all the complaints are now summarised in a single yes/no dialog</li>
					<li>url downloader pages now run a 'are you sure you want to close this page' when their import queues are unfinished and unpaused</li>
					<li>if the subscriptions for 'manage subscriptions' take more than a second to load, a popup will come up with load progress. the popup is cancellable</li>
					<li>added a prototype 'open in web browser' to the thumbnail right-click share menu. it will only appear in windows if you are in advanced mode, as atm it mostly just launches the file in the default program, not browser. I will keep working on this</li>
					<li>harmonised more old download code into a single location in the new system</li>
					<li>created a neater network job factory system for generalised network requests at the import job level</li>
					<li>created a neater presentation context factory system for generalised and reliable set/clear network job ui presentation at the import job level</li>
					<li>moved the new downloader simple-file-download-and-import to the new file object and harmonised all downloader code to call this single location where possible</li>
					<li>did the same thing with download-post-and-then-fetch-tags-and-file job and added hooks for in the subscription and gallery downloader loops (where a parser match for the url is found)</li>
					<li>the simple downloader and urls downloader now use 'downloader instance' network jobs, so they obey a couple more bandwidth rules</li>
					<li>harmonised how imported media is then presented to pages as thumbnails through the new main import object</li>
					<li>the new post downloader sets up referral urls for the file download (which are needed for pixiv and anything else picky) automatically</li>
					<li>improved file download/import error reporting a little</li>
					<li>entering an invalid regex phrase in the stringmatch panel (as happens all the time as you type it) will now present the error in the status area rather than spamming popups</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in the new parsing gui that was prohibiting editing a date decode string transformation</li>
					<li>fixed enabling of additional date decode controls in the string transformations edit panel</li>
					<li>added a hyperlink to date decoding controls that links to python date decoding explainer</li>
					<li>if a source time in the new parsing system suggests a time in the future, it will now clip to 30s ago</li>
					<li>misc downloader refactoring and cleanup</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where new file lookup scripts were initialising with bad string transformation rows and breaking the whole dialog in subsequent calls, fugg</li>
					<li>hid the 'find similar files' menu entry for images that have duration (gifs and apngs), which are not yet supported</li>
					<li>added 'flip_debug_force_idle_mode_do_not_set_this' to main_gui shortcut set. only set it if you are an advanced user and prepared for the potential consequences</li>
					<li>silenced a problem with newgrounds gallery parser--will fix it properly next week</li>
					<li>fixed some old busted unit test code</li>
					<li>rejiggered some thumb dupe menu entry layout</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 304</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>renamed the new 'tagcensor' object to 'tagfilter' (since it will end up doing a bunch of non-censoring jobs) and refactored it into clienttags</li>
					<li>attached a tag filter object to all tag import options to act as a tag blacklist. all tags that go through the import pipeline (except for a couple of old legacy instances) are now checked against the blacklist, and if a bad tag is found, the file vetoes! tag import options has some new ui to handle this and background code to deal with inheritance from defaults and so on</li>
					<li>new file import urls that have url classes, no matter their source, are now normalised!</li>
					<li>all new file import urls are now tested against both the original and normalised version of the url, so even though previously parsed urls remain un-normalised, new urls that are pre-normalised the same will not count as new! -fingers crossed-</li>
					<li>on update, the db will get normalised copies of all existing urls. this means many files will now have two versions of its urls--some ui to collapse everything down to only the normalised version (after some human eyes have passed in front of this big change) will come in the coming weeks</li>
					<li>some sites where normalisation is a consistent problem for later redownloads (like e621, which appends 'preview' tags to the post url) _should_ now be caught reliably!</li>
					<li>the 'allow subdomains' on edit url class panel is now named 'match subdomains' and has a tooltip to better explain how it works</li>
					<li>'keep subdomains' is now 'keep matched subdomains' and has a tooltip as well</li>
					<li>the 'keep matched subdomains' enabled behaviour (and some normalisation calculation) is now additionally governed by the 'associate url with files' value and api url conversion info rather than just 'match subdomains' and raw url type</li>
					<li>fixed an issue that was stopping the 'associate url with files' option sticking in edit url class panel</li>
					<li>edit url matches now resorts after an add or edit action</li>
					<li>all listctrls with a wrapper panel now resort after an import from clipboard, png, or defaults call</li>
					<li>url matches now match against www*. versions of their domain regardless of 'match subdomains' settings</li>
					<li>updated xbooru url classes to prefer https</li>
					<li>the manage url class links panel now has a 'clear' button to clear a url_class->parser link</li>
					<li>introduced three new simple downloader parsers for yiff.party, thanks to @cuddlebear on discord for the submission</li>
					<li>the old 'uninteresting mime' status has been expanded to a wider 'vetoed' status to represent all file imports that are abandoned without a particular error (e.g. tag blacklist, wrong filesize or resolution)</li>
					<li>the import system now reports the total of 'num vetoed' as 'num ignored' in its summary statements</li>
					<li>it now also reports 'num skipped'</li>
					<li>the 'num successful' and 'num already in db' are now folded more neatly together in import cache summary statements</li>
					<li>file downloads that are cancelled will now set a 'veto' state rather than a 'skip' state</li>
					<li>improved file import exception handling across the board</li>
					<li>improved how single-file-result parsing vetoes propagate up to the file import status cache</li>
					<li>404 network errors will now provide a 'veto' status rather than an 'error'</li>
					<li>vetoes will not count as errors when deciding whether a subscription should be abandoned early (so a bunch of decomp bombs or 404s will no longer stutter a subscription!)</li>
					<li>misc fixes and improvements to the new download stuff</li>
					<li>wrote a new parsing cache that saves a lot of work in the new parsing system</li>
					<li>improved the 'is this url known?' test to better deal with situations where all the given urls are galleries or unrecognised--a better aggregate of file status is formed, and 'already in db'/'deleted' statuses will apply if there is no evidence otherwise (the dev got the new logic for this from a legit nightmare about urls downloading over and over, so let's hope it works out)</li>
					<li>the 'is this url known?' logic also recovers from 1->n url->hash relationships where it does not expect them, trying to find 'already in db' hashes over 'deleted' ones</li>
					<li>to clear up some ambiguity, galleries or subscriptions now give a different 'checking in x seconds' status when waiting on the first page of a query</li>
					<li>the 'noneablebytescontrol', as seen in edit file import options, will now correctly disable/enable its bytes sub-control when it is none'ed</li>
					<li>a persistent issue with the new network engine sometimes failing to correctly error after certain broken connections (the computer going to sleep mid-download was a common cause here) should now be recovered from and the connection naturally reattempted</li>
					<li>added three new shortcuts to the 'main_gui' shortcut set that allow for opening a new 'urls', 'simple', or 'thread watcher' downloader page</li>
					<li>added two more shortcuts to 'main_gui' for new 'page of pages' and 'duplicate filter page'</li>
					<li>moved some old 'new page' menu code to the new application command system</li>
					<li>added numerous 'duplicates' shortcuts to the 'media' shortcut set that will work on selections of thumbnails</li>
					<li>the thumbnail duplicates menu actions now go through the new application command system</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the current tag parents caches was not refreshing when notified</li>
					<li>inputting a short invalid syntactic input on a 'read' tag autocomplete such as '-' will now clear the system predicates list--system preds should now only show on a completely empty input</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where certain combinations of 'remove a tag, then re-add it' nullipotent actions in a single manage tags dialog transaction were not applying reliably (sometimes, the subsequent mirror action was not occuring due to a processing re-order optimisation at the db level)</li>
					<li>made some animation code a little safer and quieter as a test for some users who were getting blitzed with some deadwindow error spam in certain situations--let's see if this changes anything</li>
					<li>replaced all the em dashes in the help with double hyphens as github pages was rendering them wrong</li>
					<li>added CrystalDiskInfo recommendation to 'help my db is broke.txt'</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 303</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>file post url classes can now be linked to parsers!</li>
					<li>the 'raw url' downloader is now just the 'url' downloader. if a dropped url is matched as a 'file post' url and links to a parser, it will download it with that parser and default tag import options</li>
					<li>url drag and drop now recognises file post urls that have linked parsers and will send them on to a url import page, just like 'raw' urls! they will use the new parsing system to parse tags and known urls and all that</li>
					<li>wrote a way for the new download system to store and edit default tag import options--this can now be found under network->manage default tag import options, although it does not do much yet. eventually the old options will be transferred here, and the different downloaders will consult it more</li>
					<li>refactored and cleaned up how some default tag import option calculation is done</li>
					<li>the fixed 5 second wait time between gallery page fetches is now editable for downloader pages and subscriptions under options->downloading. subscriptions default remains 5s, gallery default is now 15s</li>
					<li>the gallery downloader will present its 'x urls found so far' string in a more uniform and reactive way. it will also count down until the next page fetch</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now similarly react quicker while the gallery parse step is ongoing, and it will count down to the next page fetch</li>
					<li>the manage subscriptions dialog will now note in BIG RED TEXT if subscriptions are currently globally paused</li>
					<li>subscriptions now consume less parallel-timeslot overhead, meaning they sync much faster when they have no work to do (which is most of the time)</li>
					<li>separating subscriptions is now more sophisticated--if you wish, you can now choose just to separate a subset of the large subs's queries, and if you do so, you can decide whether to merge the extracted subs into a new larger sub or just have them as individuals. also, you will be asked for name/base_name for what to name the new subs</li>
					<li>since separating subs is more complicated, the button is only enabled when a single large sub is selected. please do your separating one sub at a time!</li>
					<li>merging subs will now ask if you want to rename the merged subs as it goes</li>
					<li>refactored a giant heap of duplicate import code into single locations in the new file import object--things like applying tags and generating pre-import status are all now done in one place. a number of weird behaviours (like not applying known url associations in certain circumstances) should now be a lot better and unified</li>
					<li>the way the db and other import testers handle whether a pending import is new or unknown is simplified</li>
					<li>optimised the way the importers figure out whether to display a new import</li>
					<li>the 'has the client seen this url before?' test used to figure out whether to download a file now explicitly ignores anything it isn't certain is a single-file File URL or Post URL (according to current url classes). associating 'gallery' known urls is no longer catastrophic to this system</li>
					<li>the simple downloader now associates the entered url with the files subsequently imported</li>
					<li>file import objects working in the new parsing system are aware of the new 'should this url be associated' option and will be given gallery urls to hold on to as appropriate</li>
					<li>url classes now have an explicit option as to whether they should be associated with files imported from them, which is not appropriate for dynamic CDN File URLs but is appropriate for multi-image tweet links (which will likely be Gallery URLs in the new system), for instance</li>
					<li>general importer code cleanup across the board</li>
					<li>threw together some early ui to show current jobs in the network engine under network->review network jobs</li>
					<li>popup messages will now try to set a max width of roughly 56 characters wide rather than 400 pixels. this value is editable under options->gui</li>
					<li>updated the listctrl in the export files frame and the way this frame generates and stores export filenames. let's see if linux users who had crashes with this have better luck</li>
					<li>refactored stuff out of the bloated ClientImporting file into seperate new files</li>
					<li>refactored client network bandwidth and session code out to their own files as well</li>
					<li>refactored client network objects to its own file</li>
					<li>cleaned up some open externally debug code linked to callto report mode</li>
					<li>a common grid layout used across the program will copy control tooltips to the string on the left</li>
					<li>removed the 'downloader' network context type, which was never fully introduced and wasn't turning out to offer much in the new bandwidth tracking system</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 302</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>improved how simple downloader parsing formulae are stored and passed around</li>
					<li>the edit simple downloader parsing formulae panel now has an 'add defaults' menu button</li>
					<li>the simple downloader formula edit panel handles its buttons better and can now do import from/export to clipboard/png and reimport from the defaults, and fixes duplicate names automatically</li>
					<li>simple downloaders now remember their current parser through a session save/load</li>
					<li>simple downloaders will set a new default parser selection for new simple downloader pages on any choice event</li>
					<li>renamed all the default simple downloader parsers to more clearly explain what they do</li>
					<li>added 'all files linked by images in page' to the simple downloader, which does the old page of images' behaviour, and is hence pretty decent for most imageboards</li>
					<li>added a simple mewch thread html parse formula to the simple downloader</li>
					<li>added a very simple webmshare parse formula to the simple downloader</li>
					<li>added 'imgur image album' to the simple downloader, which will fetch the first 'page' of results from an image album. full parsing will have to wait for the gallery downloader update</li>
					<li>subscriptions can now run simultaneously! you can set the max number at options->downloading page--the default remains 1, so default behaviour will not change</li>
					<li>if subscriptions guess they can eat some bandwidth in the next 30s but it turns out they can't, they will bandwidth-override that last job after the 30s expires. this will stop some edge cases from causing subs to potentially hang for hours just on one last request</li>
					<li>'explicit tags' are now renamed to 'additional tags'</li>
					<li>you can now set media to initially scale to 100% even when it is larger than the media or preview canvas</li>
					<li>the html parsing formula can now 'ascend' as well as search down the DOM tree--so, for instance, you can find all 'img' below an 'a' and then jump back up to the 'a' to fetch the 'href' of that image link!</li>
					<li>html parsing formulae can now search without a tag name--so, for instance, 'find all tags with class = "whatever"' is doable, without having to specify div or span etc..</li>
					<li>the html parsing formula rule panel is hence a bit richer. it also presents a preview of the rule's string as you edit</li>
					<li>the client no longer needs lxml to boot, and if html5lib is present, it will prefer that for html parsing. if both libraries are missing and html parsing is requested, it will raise an exception explaining the error</li>
					<li>the builds now include html5lib, which is better at recovering from some bad markup than lxml, and as a result some parsing jobs that formerly did not work (such as 'akaiha_(akaihasugk)' on danbooru) now do</li>
					<li>rewrote how services test their functional status to better account for different states. the logic here should be a bit better now--repositories will still be able to process if their network side is down, but everything will pause if any pause is set, and it should all propagate up to higher levels of error catching and status reporting better</li>
					<li>hydrus can now deal with really big decompression bombs (>~180 megapixel)</li>
					<li>filtered out en-dashes (as an alternative to standard hyphens in a "? + -" link-prefix) from booru tag parsing</li>
					<li>fixed a string generation issue that was stopping date decode string transformations from summarising themselves</li>
					<li>fixed some catastrophic boot failure gui reporting</li>
					<li>cleaned up a double-exit error on dialogs that could occur when spamming exit events with a script like AutoHotkey</li>
					<li>improved some dead cpu thread clearout code</li>
					<li>updated misc old code</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 301</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>after discussions with Sankaku Complex about their recent bandwidth problems, added a new 64MB/day default bandwidth rule for sankakucomplex.com--please check the release post for more information</li>
					<li>the 'page of images downloader' is now called the 'simple downloader' that uses the new parsing system (particularly, a single formula to parse urls)</li>
					<li>the simple downloader supports multiple named parsers--currently defaulting to: html 4chan and 8chan threads, all images, gfycat mp4, gfycat webm, imgur image, imgur video, and twitter images (which fetches the :orig and also works on galleries!)</li>
					<li>there is some basic editing of these parsing formulae, but it isn't pretty or easy to import/export yet</li>
					<li>the new parsing test panel now has a 'link' button that lets you fetch test data straight from a URL</li>
					<li>added a 'gather to this page of pages->dead thread watchers' menu to the page of pages right-click menu--it searches for all 404/DEAD thread watchers in the current page structure and puts them in the clicked page of pages!</li>
					<li>cleaned up some page tab right-click menu layout and order</li>
					<li>fixed tag parents, which I previously broke while optimising their load time fugg</li>
					<li>the new favourites list now presents parents in 'write' tag contexts, like manage tags--see if you like it (maybe this is better if hidden?)</li>
					<li>sped up known_url searches for most situations</li>
					<li>fixed an unusual error when drag-and-dropping a focused collection thumbnail to a new page</li>
					<li>fixed a problem that was marking collected thumbnails' media as not eligible for the archive/delete filter</li>
					<li>wrote a 'subscription report mode' that will say some things about subscriptions and their internal test states as they try (and potentially fail) to run</li>
					<li>if a subscription query fails to find any files on its first sync, it will give a better text popup notification</li>
					<li>if a subscription query finds files in its initial sync but does not have bandwidth to download them, a FYI text popup notification will explain what happened and how to review estimated wait time</li>
					<li>delete key now deletes from file import status lists</li>
					<li>default downloader tag import options will now inherit the fetch_tags_even_if_url_known_and_file_already_in_db value more reliably from 'parent' default options objects (like 'general boorus'->'specific booru')</li>
					<li>the db maintenance routine 'clear file orphans' will now move files to a chosen location as it finds them (previously, it waited until the end of the search to do the move). if the user chooses to delete, this will still be put off until the end of the search (so a mid-search cancel event in this case remains harmless)</li>
					<li>the migrate database panel should now launch ok even if a location does not exist (it will also notify you about this)</li>
					<li>brushed up some help (and updated a screenshot) about tag import options</li>
					<li>fixed a problem that stopped some old manage parsing scripts ui (to content links) from opening correctly</li>
					<li>improved some parsing test code so it can't hang the client on certain network problems</li>
					<li>misc ui code updates</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 300</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote system:known url to find files that have--or do not have--certain types of urls. it works but is still a little slow--I can optimise it later!</li>
					<li>added exact match, domain, regex, and url class search types for system:known url</li>
					<li>added a button to the top media viewer hover window that will start a file export drag and drop event if dragged from</li>
					<li>moved the autocomplete dropdown results list down into a paged notebook</li>
					<li>wrote a new 'favourites' page tab for the autocomplete dropdown results</li>
					<li>hitting left or right arrow keys on an empty text input will move between the results tabs</li>
					<li>hitting arrow up/down/page up/down/home/page or passing mouse scroll events will now go to the current selected page</li>
					<li>typing regular search text into the input will automatically return the current page to the search results list</li>
					<li>moved the 'tag suggestions' part of the 'tags' options page to a new page</li>
					<li>added 'tag favourites' to the 'tags' options page to edit which tags show in this new tab</li>
					<li>added import/export buttons to the tag siblings and parents dialogs. they'll export to clipboard or .txt file, and import from the same with an additional option to add_only (i.e. to not delete/petition conflicts with the existing list)</li>
					<li>added some quick-and-dirty 'set as alternates/same/notdupes' buttons to the duplicate filter, which will quickly apply that status to the dupes and show some more dupes</li>
					<li>sped up db loading time of tag siblings and parents significantly</li>
					<li>added a short delay check to tag siblings/parents regeneration so rapid regenerations (such as when processing certain admin-side petitions) can be merged</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where similar_to searches could return results not in the current file domain</li>
					<li>fixed some spinctrls that were sizing to thin</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in the manage server services dialog that was incorrectly dealing with port conflicts on edit service dialog ok</li>
					<li>added a clientside and serverside assertion to test that all the services on a serverside modify services call have unique ports</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where hydrus network services without access keys would sometimes try to sync their accounts (this was messing up some admin server setup)</li>
					<li>fixed some misc dialog window structure</li>
					<li>messed around a little with how the autocomplete dropdown hides and shows when in float mode--I _think_ it will now be less flickery and will otherwise position itself and receieve focus better</li>
					<li>converted the 'export files' dialog to the new sizing system and also made it non-modal (i.e. you can now interact with the rest of the program while it is open)</li>
					<li>wrote a more rigorous force-fit-all-tlws command to the debug menu</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 299</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote ui to review and even edit session cookies by network context. it is still a bit rough but will help with future development.</li>
					<li>added a 'open_selection_in_new_page' shortcut to the 'media' shortcut set that will work on the thumbnail view</li>
					<li>added a 'export_files' shortcut to the 'media' shortcut set that will work on the thumbnail view</li>
					<li>fudged manage siblings logic to not do the borked 'hey, that sibling already exists' as soon as you type the old sibling--it will now auto-petition any existing siblings when you click 'add' with a good automated petition reason that makes sense to the janitor</li>
					<li>manage siblings now also only shows rows appropriate to the current selection like parents does. it gets a new 'notes' column to specify conflicts that will be auto-petitioned as above</li>
					<li>manage siblings and parents now have a laggy 'show all pairs' checkbox to let you quickly review everything like you used to</li>
					<li>fixed a database-level bug that meant petitioned and pending the same left-hand sibling tag (like petition a->b, pend a->c) would sometimes not both save together</li>
					<li>when you middle-click or right-click->open a new page on a selection of tags/search predicates, the new page will now be named after the tags</li>
					<li>if subscriptions hit their periodic file limit, they will now give a little popup message describing what happened and possible causes and actions the user can take</li>
					<li>added a 'make a modal popup in five seconds' action to help->debug</li>
					<li>modal popups will now hide/show other child frames (like review services) rather than minimise/restore, as this latter action can raise the entire progam to the front</li>
					<li>added a 'make a parentless text control dialog' debug entry to test some key event catching</li>
					<li>added a 'layout all tlws' debug entry to help->debug that'll hopefully help figure out some child window sizing/position issues</li>
					<li>added a 'shortcut report mode', which will report caught shortcut keys and their matched commands, if any</li>
					<li>fixed a little shortcut catching bug in the main gui</li>
					<li>finished adding the new bytes control</li>
					<li>updated ffmpeg for windows</li>
					<li>improved sankaku default bandwidth rules to stop a subscription bandwidth rules mismatch that could sometimes make for subscription delays--existing users may like to add a 2GB/day rule for sankakucomplex.com</li>
					<li>improved some service and account error handling to better propagate the exact problem up the exception handling chain</li>
					<li>the clientside 'update A actually had hash B' repository sync error is now dealt with in a less severe way, and the bad update file is saved to disk with a request for it to be forwarded to hydrus dev for further investigation</li>
					<li>file parsing is now more resistant to invalid negative values for properties like width, height, and duration</li>
					<li>improved some focus code that may have been affecting linux stability</li>
					<li>improved a deviant art url-not-found error</li>
					<li>improved a wx version boot test</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 298</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote a new 'bytescontrol' and related noneablebytescontrol that allows for a uniform way to choose a bytes size value with a wider range--and deployed it all over the place</li>
					<li>hitting a mapped shortcut for 'manage file notes' should now ok the 'manage file notes' dialog as well as open it</li>
					<li>the manage file notes text control will now start with its caret at the end of the document</li>
					<li>manage siblings/parents now state how many pairs they have</li>
					<li>as an experiment, manage parents now only lists pertinent information in its listctrl. this is hacky but potentially a big improvement to the workflow here, feedback would be appreciated</li>
					<li>added a new menu entry, 'network->pause->all new network traffic', which will indefinitely pause any new network jobs. this value will persist through a restart</li>
					<li>'pause subscriptions' is moved from 'services' to 'network'</li>
					<li>'pause import/export folders' is moved to 'file' and all the import/export folder stuff is sent down to its own submenu</li>
					<li>in lieu of proper session inspection gui, added some debug 'reset login' entries to the network menu for pixiv and hf</li>
					<li>if a page has files but none are selected, it will now say the total size in the status bar</li>
					<li>the edit bandwidth rules control and its subsidiary dialog use some saner and more user-friendly layout and presentation</li>
					<li>the previous search distance on the 'review bandwidth usage' frame is now remembered</li>
					<li>fixed some bad logic where a 'copy_bmp' event could trigger despite the current media being None or a non-static image</li>
					<li>you can no longer open multiple copies of the subscriptions or import/export folder manage dialogs if you hit the menu entry multiple times while the first is waiting for the jobs to finish</li>
					<li>like import folders and subscriptions, manage export folders now waits for currently running export folders to quit before opening</li>
					<li>export folders run lighter and quit faster on client shutdown</li>
					<li>the domain manager will give a better error if a URL submitted to it lacks a schema (the http or https part)</li>
					<li>fixed a bunch of unicode error handling</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with similar files metadata orphans prohibiting new file imports</li>
					<li>finished up a simple shared shortcut processing object and replaced most old temp duplicate shortcut code with it</li>
					<li>misc ui cleanup</li>
					<li>misc text rendering fixes</li>
					<li>misc shortcut code refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 297</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>finished a prototype 'file notes' system. thumbnails and media viewer canvas now support 'manage->file notes' in their right-click menus. this launches a simple text box which will save its contents to db</li>
					<li>added 'manage_file_notes' shortcut to the 'media' shortcut set</li>
					<li>tag summary generators now have a simple show/hide checkbox and (for thumbnails) custom colours for background and text including alpha channel!</li>
					<li>fixed a variety of timing and display logic related to subscription query DEAD vs next check time calculation</li>
					<li>all currently dead subscription queries will be revived on update, just in case they were formerly set dead by accident</li>
					<li>the 'fetch tags even if url known and file already in db' option is moved from the download/subscription panel's cog icon to tag import options</li>
					<li>cleaned up tag import options layout, controls, internal workflow, and help button</li>
					<li>added 'select all/none' buttons to tag import options panels with multiple namespaces</li>
					<li>if a subscription is blocked by bandwidth, the manage subscriptions dialog will display that in its 'recent error/delay' column</li>
					<li>the edit subscription dialog will show similar bandwidth blocking info, on a per-query basis, under a new 'recent delays' column</li>
					<li>the review bandwidth usage panel will no longer show some unusual results by default that you can see with 'show all' hit anyway</li>
					<li>the review bandwidth usage panel will show the usage at the current search distance in a new column</li>
					<li>the review bandiwdth usage panel will show number of requests after data usage. this might be info-overload, so I might alter the syntax or roll it back entirely</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with hentai foundry parser pulling images placed in the image description area instead of main image. this particularly affected the artist 'teku'</li>
					<li>tags for deviant art and tumblr and thread watchers, which were formerly stored in volatile session memory--meaning half-completed import queues were losing their tags through a program restart--are now saved to the new import object directly</li>
					<li>removed all the old volatile session memory patch code</li>
					<li>added the new import object through a larger part of the parsing pipeline</li>
					<li>deleted the old remains of the giphy parser--if it comes back, it'll all be rewritten in the new system</li>
					<li>harmonised some other import pipeline code to the new system</li>
					<li>added a new 'management and preview panels' submenu to the 'pages' menu</li>
					<li>added an option to control 'save sash positions on close' to this menu</li>
					<li>added an entry to force-save the current sash positions to this menu</li>
					<li>added an entry to 'restore' the currently saved sash positions to all pages to this menu (this is useful if your window resizes real small and all your pages get crushed up)</li>
					<li>rejiggered how URL Classes are matched with URLs to make sure some Post URLs are not lost (this was affecting Hentai Foundry Post URLs, which were sometimes not displaying in the media viewer despite matching)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the duplicate filter page's jobs would not trigger an update after a job finished</li>
					<li>fixed an outside chance of a crash after running a duplicate filter page job</li>
					<li>improved how strings are coerced to unicode--now the preferred system encoding will be tried before utf-16, which should improve support for -type characters in various non-unicode sources (like neighbouring .txt files)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the client's local booru and flash files (and some other file fetching and mime reporting is a bit faster and neater overall)</li>
					<li>the options should be more reliable about redrawing all thumbnail banner summaries on an option ok now</li>
					<li>the options->media->media zooms option will now remove any <=0.0 values when it saves</li>
					<li>fixed up some old test code</li>
					<li>improved how some thread-to-gui update reporting code works</li>
					<li>deleted some old network object code</li>
					<li>converted manage subscriptions panel to an edit panel--a decoupling refactor I will likely ultimately make across the program</li>
					<li>wrote a help page for content parsers</li>
					<li>did the first half of a help page for page parsers</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 296</h3></li>

					<li>the 'allow decompression bombs' option is now moved to 'file import options'. it defaults to False</li>
					<li>file import options now allow max size and max resolution rules. they default to None</li>
					<li>file import options now allows a max gif size rule to deal with THE SFM COMMUNITY. it defaults to 32MB</li>
					<li>file imports will give better quality errors if they fail due to file import option exclusion rules</li>
					<li>file import fail errors will now also specify the incorrect amount--e.g. if a file is 64KB but the minimum limit is 256KB, it will state this in the error</li>
					<li>wrote a bunch of unit tests to make sure the new complicated file import options object works good</li>
					<li>finished the tag summary edit ui and added a new 'tag summaries' page to the options</li>
					<li>you can set the thumbnail top, thumbnail bottom right, and media viewer top summaries here, and everything should link up right!</li>
					<li>the old options to hide thumbnail top and thumbnail bottom right text are removed from the options->gui page</li>
					<li>tag summaries now include pending tags again</li>
					<li>tag summaries will order tags according to hydrus numeric tag sorting rules (0 < 0a < 0b < 1 < 9 < 10)</li>
					<li>tag summaries will collapse namespace groups that all start with decimals into a "min-max" phrase instead of the whole list (so 'collecting' a chapter will list p1-23 for the page phrase instead of each number in turn)</li>
					<li>fixed some potential error popups from the autocomplete dropdown when not in float mode (this hit non-windows users more often)</li>
					<li>split the parser help pages up a bit more and updated the client ui html links</li>
					<li>finished off the formulae help pages</li>
					<li>updated to wx 4.0.1 on all platforms. it promises increased stability!</li>
					<li>default tag import options are now moved to the 'importing' options panel, alongside the default file import options</li>
					<li>the database will deal with and recover from rollback exceptions more reliably. rollback-loops should be fixed, but the original event will now also produce a request to restart the client (which will safely reset everything) anyway</li>
					<li>improved how I create and layout the 'help for this panel -->' help buttons</li>
					<li>the job scheduler now regularly checks for and clears out dead wx-related jobs (this saves a bit of memory)</li>
					<li>cleaned up an old tag retrieval method that was wasting CPU. some larger pages with many thousands of tags should do tag calculation after selection and so on a bit faster</li>
					<li>fixed a thread shutdown test that wasn't working until app shutdown time</li>
					<li>improved some more thread shutdown code</li>
					<li>deleted some old thread-inefficient calllater and wx-safe timer code</li>
					<li>emergency server errors that occur during the response writing stage should be handled better by the client</li>
					<li>emergency server errors are more robust in general serverside</li>
					<li>improved the quality of the errors thrown by the new network engine's login system</li>
					<li>improved some test timing and key press simulation code</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 295</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed the runtimeerror popups that would come up on restore from minimise or main gui move after the complete destruction of a general search page</li>
					<li>cleaned up some main gui move code generally, and removed a memory leak on the way</li>
					<li>file queries can now cancel at multiple checkpoints during the first phase, saving a bunch of CPU time on certain large queries that are replaced mid-search</li>
					<li>after a file query has been going three seconds, a little 'stop' button will appear beside the regular autocomplete input. clicking this will cancel the current query! it will stop when it next hits one of the checkpoints above</li>
					<li>the floating autocomplete dropdown should be less flickery in some circumstances</li>
					<li>dejanked some more file query code</li>
					<li>added a 'clear orphan file records' entry to the database->maintain menu. this looks for and purges orphan file rows as you may have seen a notification about recently. this mostly affects the duplicate filter system</li>
					<li>fixed up the delete file code to be a bit more robust--it should lead to fewer orphans in future</li>
					<li>all the parsing edit panels have new layout: they no longer have info panels but instead a help button that points to the html help, and the edit and test panels are now beside each other rather than in notebook pages</li>
					<li>harmonised a bunch of the parser ui test panel code, refactored how the results are stored</li>
					<li>the test panel now presents a better 'preview' of what it contains (the actual text control has like 64KB text limit on some OSes and has unreliable text encoding rules, so using it as the raw container for the example data has lead to problems), and we now read and write the example data with a couple of new copy to/paste from clipboard buttons</li>
					<li>wrote another new test panel for subsidiary page parsers that does the separation formula stuff a bit better. the test results now come back for all posts as well, rather than just the first</li>
					<li>added a new 'deeply_nested_dialog' frame key to options->gui for the parsing ui to better lay out five or six nested dialogs in a nice 'topleft' way</li>
					<li>the 'topleft' frame padding is reduced from 50 to 24 pixels to better fit in deeply nested dialogs</li>
					<li>misc parsing ui improvements and little fixes</li>
					<li>the manage url classes and manager parsers dialogs now have a better 'add defaults' button that allows you to just select the defaults you want (by name) from a checklistbox</li>
					<li>wrote a parser for 420chan and added it to the defaults. it should automatically add and link up when you update</li>
					<li>if the install_dir/db directory is not writable-to (e.g. you have installed the program to a protected location like "C:\Program Files"), the client and server will default to ~/Hydrus as the db directory</li>
					<li>wrote a new 'TagSummaryGenerator' class that will do 'bunch of tags'->'nice summary string' conversions for the thumbnail banners and export filenames</li>
					<li>substituted some static tagsummarygenerators to do thumbnail banners</li>
					<li>did the same for the media viewer top-center namespace summary</li>
					<li>started some edit ui for tagsummarygenerators--I'll have some proper customisable stuff in the near future</li>
					<li>moved the background memory maintenance and misc daemons to the new job scheduler, reducing thread count and idle CPU some more</li>
					<li>added a debug 'show scheduled jobs' entry for the new job scheduler system</li>
					<li>decompression bomb failures will no longer count towards a subscription's fail count, so having a bunch of them won't abandon a sync</li>
					<li>fixed and otherwise improved a potential crash condition when a thumbnail panel closes while a menu is popup'd on it</li>
					<li>to forestall this program instability, the thumbnail window will no longer replace while its menu is open. the behaviour after this delayed window delivery is slightly borked, but it isn't a crash so I'm ok with it for now</li>
					<li>removed some other jank from the thumbnail media panel swap code</li>
					<li>non-cancellable modal popups will no longer have the 'close' button. trying to close them with the dialog's X button will still give the 'sorry lad, can't cancel' error</li>
					<li>rating and file service system predicates for services that no longer exist will now render a neat 'unknown x system predicate' presentation string rather than throwing an error</li>
					<li>searches in 'all known tags'/'specific tag domain' no longer provide system:untagged, wew</li>
					<li>some delayed events are now posted in a more thread-safe way</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 294</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed video scan</li>
					<li>fixed up some import folder logic--they now run 'look for new files' checks separate from 'import anything still in the queue', so they can now catch up on outstanding files more easily</li>
					<li>the ten minute file-processing break is reverted--import folders now just 'save' every ten minutes, to forestall lost work on a crash</li>
					<li>import folders now have an explicit 'check regularly' checkbox to control whether you want it to check regularly or only when you tell it to. the paused status now means 'do not ever work'</li>
					<li>import folders now make a 'working' popup, like subscriptions do, that shows new file discovery progress and found file import progress. it has a cancel button that will stop the current job and can be hidden in the import folder's options. existing import folders will default to ON for this, so you'll likely see one of these right after you update</li>
					<li>import folders can now publish their files to a new page! this effectively cuts out the button step. furthermore, if a page already exists with the import folder's name (e.g. a previous page the import folder created is still around), the import folder will publish the new files to _that_ page, updating it</li>
					<li>file popup buttons with the same name will now 'merge'! multiple work cycles of a subscription or import folder will now just update the first button rather than spamming several</li>
					<li>running import folders will respond faster to a client shutdown event</li>
					<li>wrote some better controller-level thread management, including surplus thread deletion--idle CPU should be reduced on import-busy clients</li>
					<li>wrote some code to deal with sub-second times a bit better in certain places</li>
					<li>finished off a new scheduled job queue that collapses an old multiple-thread-when-idle system down into just one</li>
					<li>many things are moved to the new job scheduling system--all the old calllater calls, and the popup message timers as well</li>
					<li>completely removed the old wx timers the autocomplete input was using, as they were just too much of a hassle. any crashing these were causing is now gone--it all works on the simpler scheduled job queue now</li>
					<li>the autocomplete dropdowns are better at judging when to engage their timers and so now use far less idle CPU</li>
					<li>fixed a crash that could occur sometime after starting a duplicate filter maintenance task from the dupe filter page</li>
					<li>fixed several unlikely but plausible crashes on the admin-side of petition processing</li>
					<li>wrote a bunch of help for the url classes and new parsing system--it isn't finished yet, but then neither is the new system!</li>
					<li>if the client fails to initialise the db, it will now try to present the error in a bit of screenshottable-gui before the program quits</li>
					<li>improved thread watcher error handling when the given url is unwatchable</li>
					<li>lots of timer related cleanup and tiny fixes</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 293</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed the issue with options dialog not opening again after a save--I apologise for the inconvenience</li>
					<li>the default system:time imported predicate (as set in options) is reset to the default '< 7 days'</li>
					<li>fixed another potential crash with the manage tags dialog (in fact with any dialog that has an embedded autocomplete or any other autocomplete with a non-floating dropdown list, such as the import file path tagging dialog)</li>
					<li>the sankaku user-agent has been updated to be a generic Firefox string "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0", which seems to work with their new rules. if your sank has been broken and you haven't touched the settings that do this stuff, your sank should be magically fixed on update</li>
					<li>the default global hydrus user-agent has been updated to the more polite and compatible "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Hydrus Client)". if your previous global user-agent is currently 'hydrus client' (the old default), you'll be updated</li>
					<li>import folders now deal with interruptions more skillfully and take a break and save their progress every ten minutes</li>
					<li>the manage import folders dialog now waits properly for any currently running import folders to quit and save themselves before opening itself (like how the manage subs dialog does it)</li>
					<li>import folders deal with some error states in a better way and are able to cancel out of their loops more reliably when an error occurs</li>
					<li>added a new checkbox option to options->tags that lets your 'write' autocomplete inputs (ones where you can submit new tags, like in manage tags) select the first result with non-zero count by default. this means it will skip over the first result if it is just nonsense like 'boyp' that you typed to get the results</li>
					<li>linked all the final behind the scenes stuff in the thread watcher together with the new parsing system. this stuff remains complicated and non-user-friendly, so please feel free to completely ignore it and the following batch of points:</li>
					<li>-</li>
					<li>wrote new url classes and parsers for 4chan and 8chan--they should all be automatically linked up on update</li>
					<li>the new thread parsers will use the first part of the first post's comment if no subject is set</li>
					<li>the domain manager can now cope with URL->API URL links</li>
					<li>manage url class links now displays the current expected api pairs of URL class links and filters out what cannot be currently parsed as a result</li>
					<li>manage url class links now only displays watchable urls in the bottom listctrl and permits parsers to be linked!</li>
					<li>the domain manager can now try to link url classes with parsers based on example urls!</li>
					<li>a button to fill in missing links is now available on the manage url class links panel</li>
					<li>content parsers that produce urls now define different url types--file, post, and 'next gallery page'</li>
					<li>content parsers can now parse a 'source timestamp' type</li>
					<li>veto content parsers now use a StringMatch object to do their matching. existing veto content parsers will be updated and _should_ work about the same as before (unless the previous string was crazy in regex rules) using a regex match</li>
					<li>html formulas now pick up the 'string' value more reliably in complicated or mangled html</li>
					<li>html and json parsing formulas can now work without any rules, in which case they action the top level node (this is useful to replicate the json/html for subsidiary page parsing)</li>
					<li>activated some of the new file import objects' features for the new parsing system--now, they store tags and known hashes as informed by what is parsed. this information is tested and used in import</li>
					<li>the db can now test all the hash types--md5, sha1, sha256, sha512--during pre-import checking</li>
					<li>the new parsing system now takes a temporary 'parsing context' that will eventually be able to receive and serve temporary variables but at the moment just holds a 'url' entry if the parser would like to use the url used to fetch the data anywhere</li>
					<li>all the new parsing ui now has a button to edit the parsing context, and the example parsing context is saved to the topmost page parser object</li>
					<li>wrote some url classes for 420chan.org--they will be added on update</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the 4chan thread url class</li>
					<li>-</li>
					<li>the standard new listctrl panel wrapper can now now provide a special 'export to pngs' for certain named objects that will quickly export one object per png</li>
					<li>the 'import from png' dialog as launched from the standard new listctrl panel wrapper now allows multiple png selection</li>
					<li>the default parsers (and now the url classes as well) are stored in install_dir/static/defaults. they are read from here when you create a db or ask to load from defaults, so feel free to play around with this</li>
					<li>the manage services dialog now has an additional Yes/No warning/confirmation dialog if it expects to delete any services on dialog ok</li>
					<li>page tabs escape mnemonic characters (typically '&', which in ui labelling rules makes the following character an underlined shortcut) more reliably</li>
					<li>in an attempt to stop subs making so many separate small file popups, the subscription daemon will now only naturally check every four hours (previously one hour) and will wait up to ten minutes for bandwidth to free up before dumping out (previously 30 seconds). these values will be user-configurable in a future update</li>
					<li>fixed import for some unusual apngs</li>
					<li>corrected some more GMT/local time stuff with the new system:time imported 'date' mode</li>
					<li>misc GMT/local time fixes (profile logs names themselves correctly, etc..)</li>
					<li>improved how the thread watcher reports thread-check errors in unusual situations</li>
					<li>fixed an issue generating network contexts when the initial domain is 'localhost'</li>
					<li>improved some misc program stability</li>
					<li>started a new job scheduler object to reduce idle thread count and CPU usage--will play around with it a bit more and see about integrating it in the coming weeks</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 292</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>extended system:age to support searching by fixed calendar date, e.g. "system:age > 2018/01/24"</li>
					<li>'system:age' is also renamed to 'system:time imported' and presents nicer strings</li>
					<li>I believe I have fixed the manage tags dialog crash</li>
					<li>the manage tags dialog now loads related tags, file lookup script info, and recent tags off the main ui thread, meaning the dialog itself should launch much faster in almost all situations</li>
					<li>cleaned up how a bunch of autocomplete<->manage tags events occur</li>
					<li>'set_search_focus' works in the manage tags dialog again, drawing from the new shortcut system</li>
					<li>fixed ctrl+scrollwheel on autocomplete entry, which now correctly scrolls the selection over the results again</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of the taglist scroll and selection code, particularly for tag children/parent selection events</li>
					<li>fixed a potential crash bug initiated by en early exit from the export files dialog</li>
					<li>fixed a potential crash bug initiated by an early petition processing page delete</li>
					<li>fixed a potential crash bug initiated by an edit repository close during access key fetching</li>
					<li>the thumbnail view should be a bit less jittery--the scrollbar should fade neater on mouseover, and maybe the thumbs are smoother as well (I turned off a now-superfluous double-buffering mode, please report any visual bugs)</li>
					<li>added 'check_all_import_folders' to main_gui shortcut actions</li>
					<li>menus off the main menubar that are out of date (this often happens to 'pages' after a session addition/delete) will now be disabled (greyed out) until they are back in sync</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now detects media it cannot display more carefully. if it runs across undisplayable media due to file orphan status, it will skip over it. if there is nothing else to display, it will ask the user to inform hydrus dev</li>
					<li>added json support to the parsing engine!</li>
					<li>wrote a new json parsing formula object</li>
					<li>wrote a new 'compound' parsing formula object that combines multiple formulae together</li>
					<li>wrote new panel for editing formulae with some cleaner button workflow</li>
					<li>added multiple 'separated' content parsing solutions to page parsers and wrote all new gui to reflect that</li>
					<li>expanded the new separated content parsing solutions to be full-blown nested sub-page-parsers, wew</li>
					<li>put some more general work into the new parsing engine--the new page parser object now saves and serialises, so it can be imported and exported. I don't expect to change it much more, but don't rely on that! this is all still under construction</li>
					<li>added 'file hash' content type to content parsers and improved ui support for when string conversion rules generate bytes data etc...</li>
					<li>new parsing objects now render their parsable content correctly in the 'produces' column</li>
					<li>misc cleanup of new and existing parsing dialogs</li>
					<li>fixed the handling of escape/cancel events on the 'select from a list of strings' dialog</li>
					<li>on update, users with a certain kind of orphaned file will be informed of the numbers and a request to inform hydrus dev</li>
					<li>fixed exporting serialisable object to png, which was failing due to a bmp data change in the new wx</li>
					<li>fixed a couple of places where I was switching GMT and local time around</li>
					<li>deleted some old useless tag editing and commandevent code</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 291</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>expanded the permissible shortcut keys to all reasonable ASCII characters, such as comma and ampersand and the types of brackets</li>
					<li>fixed a delayed crash sometimes caused by the file import frame (the one launched by dropping some files on the client or going file->import files)</li>
					<li>the file import frame does its file parsing job in a generally more sensible way, particularly when new drops occur while parsing is ongoing</li>
					<li>fixed a crash that could be initiated by the manage tags dialog setting the favourite tags late</li>
					<li>fixed a crash that could be initiated by manage parents closing before results came in</li>
					<li>fixed a rare possible crash that could be initiated by a review service panel delivering results late</li>
					<li>when media pages load, they will be more thread-crash-polite to wx</li>
					<li>wrote a new 'PageParser' object that will be the primary parser in the new downloader engine. this can deal with a variety of complicated parsing situations. it is still a work in progress, not yet ready for proper use</li>
					<li>started new 'manage parsers' dialog for the new parsing system and arranged a bunch of things around that to make the eventual transition easier</li>
					<li>edited some more old 'parsing scripts' ui to again make the transition easier. file lookup scripts will be converted to something new as we move to the new parsing system</li>
					<li>fixed some bugs in contentparser instantiation</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in the html tag rule edit dialog that wouldn't allow attribute pair editing</li>
					<li>the names in the manage tags file lookup script dropdown are now sorted</li>
					<li>removed some old redundant error-hiding code from the pubsub system</li>
					<li>a common 'is my page closed' check is now a lot simpler and faster</li>
					<li>fixed an edge shutdown bug where log messages were not able to be written to the log file</li>
					<li>some media viewer objects delete themselves more safely</li>
					<li>maybe fixed a rare menu refresh bug in linux</li>
					<li>improved how hydrus deletes temp paths--if they are 'in use by another process', it will now put them aside and try again later. this error typically occurs when file mimetype parsing fails, and due to the error context hanging around, an open file handle is still in scope.</li>
					<li>the client is better about recovering from missing tags in the db--in certain circumstances, it will now generate a 'unknown tag:random hex' as a simple placeholder that can be better used to investigate the error, rather than dumping out</li>
					<li>downgraded os x opencv to 3.1.0 to hoyefully increase compatibility</li>
					<li>the server closes a little more neatly</li>
					<li>upnp errors are more verbose</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 290</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>content (tag and rating) shortcuts in the 'media' shortcut set now work on the thumbnail view!</li>
					<li>tags in lexicophically sorted taglists will now sort numerically if their subtags start with decimals (e.g. page:3 will come before page:20 now)</li>
					<li>trying to add/edit a subscription query that is a dupe will now give you a messagebox saying no, and pasting multiple queries will filter out the dupes and inform you (so, if you aren't sure if some of your list of ten artists to add is already in your big 'artist sub', just paste them anyway--it'll take out the dupes for you)</li>
					<li>string converters now support regex substitution! (I expect to eventually integrate this into the filename tag parsing panel!)</li>
					<li>'modal' popup messages (that create a new dialog and stop interaction with the program, like the one launched for repository processing) will now minimise non-main-gui frames while they work. these frames will be restored when the job is done (this should relieve the problem of this modal dialog sometimes letting other semi-stay_on_top frames obscure it while still prohibiting interaction, wew</li>
					<li>simplified and sped up how importers decide whether to do file work or wait</li>
					<li>made file importers do ui-polite pauses during the file import loop more intelligently--if the files make no big change to db or ui (e.g file was known already deleted because of its url), no wait will occur at all, meaning redundant lean queue-sections should work real quick</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with multiply-nested submenus sometimes not deleting themselves neatly and resulting in highlight-related RuntimeErrors.</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the 'select from list' dialog could sometimes be ok'd without a valid entry--I believe this may be have been causing a delayed crash as well</li>
					<li>added a 'ui timer profile' mode, which profiles some common unified ui update loops that draw animations and keep downloader ui synced and so on</li>
					<li>the 'delete processed' file import status right-click menu entry will no longer show if it has the same count as the 'successful' line</li>
					<li>the options->colours panel has some better layout and the namespace listbox asks a yes/no  to delete if you double-click/enter a colour</li>
					<li>dropping a raw file url onto the client will now automatically pend it to a raw url importer (previously, it would be put in the input box, but after rethinking how this could go wrong, I concluded it wasn't such a big deal). if you use this a lot, see how you like it, and let me know if you would want an option to revert to the old behaviour</li>
					<li>updated domain manager so it tracks url class identity in a neater way (renaming them will no longer break links or display options)</li>
					<li>improved some widget feedback of edit url class panel</li>
					<li>simplified the manage url class links panel</li>
					<li>url classes now normalise gallery and page urls differently (page urls strip all non-declared data, gallery urls just switch scheme). this may change in future</li>
					<li>url classes can now convert a normalised url to an api url--for instance for informing the program that an imageboard thread url has an api version that'll be better to check</li>
					<li>the domain manager can now determine arbitrary url parsability capability, and this is just starting to be integrated into url drag-and-drop--try dropping a known url class on the client, like a booru link: it'll now tell you it sees what it is but can't yet parse it!</li>
					<li>the 4chan and 8chan thread url classes will reset to defaults again this week--replacing with url classes that convert to the api versions--and you'll get the new api url classes themselves</li>
					<li>if missing, the primary tables in client.caches.db can now regenerate on boot. they aren't properly repopulated yet, but the client will boot and you'll get an error message telling you what to do next</li>
					<li>improved .txt and clipboard tag import unicode support</li>
					<li>removed leading BOM (byte order mark) from .txt and clipboard tag imports</li>
					<li>improved some clipboard text fetching code</li>
					<li>added a new 'hover window profile mode' to the debug menu--it will print the logic info behind any media viewer's hover window show/hide decision</li>
					<li>tweaked the locale-setting code, which was stopping some users (on Win10 creator's update, it seems) from booting the client</li>
					<li>added system:rating to 'all known files' query contexts (so you can now search for deleted files that have ratings)</li>
					<li>the manage import folders dialog now has a redtext warning about subdirectories</li>
					<li>some file importers deal with shutdown events more gracefully</li>
					<li>lz4 is no longer required. if it is absent, or the version is too old, a simple statement will be printed to the log and it will not be used in either the client or server</li>
					<li>updated to ffmpeg 3.4.1 on windows</li>
					<li>updated opencv to 3.4 on windows and linux (had trouble with os x--will continue working on it next week)</li>
					<li>fixed an important grammar typo in the help</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 289</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed an issue where scrollbars were only appearing on taglists after a resize event</li>
					<li>fixed the raw filename component of file drag and drop events from the client to external programs</li>
					<li>fixed the tag lookup scripts</li>
					<li>fixed some wx menuhighlight issues</li>
					<li>improved some shutdown code</li>
					<li>fixed the add/edit namespace colours options panel, which needed to be updated to deal with the new wx's better alpha channel reporting</li>
					<li>fixed an issue when hitting 'open externally' on a media collection</li>
					<li>fixed a crash on client shutdown whenever closed pages were in the undo menu</li>
					<li>think I fixed another shutdown crash</li>
					<li>fixed a rare issue with the collect by dropdown not being able to generate a string to display</li>
					<li>misc wx fixes</li>
					<li>added a 'importing' page to the options dialog, which now sets the default file import options for quiet and loud file import contexts</li>
					<li>the old and no longer used 'exclude deleted files' option is now removed from the 'files and trash' panel</li>
					<li>finished off default url matches for all downloaders that come with the program--these will be set on update, so if you have custom ones, please export them before you update so you can import them again!</li>
					<li>improved how urls are matched and presented for the user in the media viewer</li>
					<li>added a 'delete "successful" file imports from the queue' entry to the file import status button right-click menu--this only removes 'successful' and 'already in db', leaving anomalies</li>
					<li>improved locale instantiation in the client and added locale strings to the help->about dialog</li>
					<li>you can now set the page name prefix for a paused thread checker. it defaults to a unicode pause character: ?</li>
					<li>thread watchers will no longer pause on a network error during a check--they now have a 'delay' system like subscriptions, and on a network error, they will delay four hours (unless you hit 'check now')</li>
					<li>patched in some simple 'connection cutoff' network error handling, we'll see how it does</li>
					<li>wrote in some more proper error handling for a specific connection cutoff error that is being produced</li>
					<li>the similar files search tree regen code now clears out orphaned files. if you have had blank 'unknown' files appear in similar files searches, please run database->regen->similar files search tree</li>
					<li>bitmap buttons on download pages will now update using less CPU and will flicker less</li>
					<li>improved some video rendering error reporting</li>
					<li>fixed the 'author name' regex favourite default, which had a superfluous asterisk. if you would like to fix it yourself, please try: [^\\]+(?=\s-)</li>
					<li>added 'flush log' debug command</li>
					<li>client.pyw now makes a safe 'system' ui error popup if it fails to boot</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 288</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>updated to wxPython Phoenix (4.0) build!</li>
					<li>all builds now require the new wx, so if you run from source, please consult the help files for new info on figuring this out</li>
					<li>did a ton of wx refactoring</li>
					<li>merged a large number of timers</li>
					<li>wrote a new wx-aware timer to replace some of the more awkward old timers that could not be neatly merged</li>
					<li>replaced wx.calllaters (the new ones aren't always garbage collecting nicely) with the new custom timer object</li>
					<li>misc wx deprecation refactoring</li>
					<li>cleaned up some wx test code</li>
					<li>fixed some crashing wx test code</li>
					<li>fixed 'select from list of strings' object, which was no longer processing enter key properly</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of ui object interaction code</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of wx-related shutdown code</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the splash window not shutting down cleanly</li>
					<li>fixed a shutdown db-gui status report crash</li>
					<li>was unable to get flash embed windows working properly without edge-case crashing on windows, so they are disabled for now (you'll likely get an 'open externally' button instead)</li>
					<li>animations now clean up their memory buffer faster in certain circumstances--all users who view animations in the preview window should notice significantly leaner 'idle' memory usage over time</li>
					<li>fixed a very important inefficiency bug that meant select->inbox/archive on large pages with more than a handful of inbox files was taking extremely long periods of 100% CPU</li>
					<li>wrote a faster way of fetching some media and their paths</li>
					<li>copying files to clipboard is now much faster</li>
					<li>initialising any large file drag-and-drop event is now much faster</li>
					<li>certain redundant image pre-fetching will no longer be done</li>
					<li>'open externally' panels will no longer draw a (slightly buggy and useless) animation bar if the underlying media would have had one</li>
					<li>added a new 'menu profile mode' that will profile any menu click</li>
					<li>cleaned up the debug menu</li>
					<li>deleted some old options code that is no longer used</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 287</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>thumbnails can now be drag-and-dropped to other pages!</li>
					<li>dragging and dropping thumbs to another page tab will remove them from the source and append them to the destination, maintaining file order!</li>
					<li>DnDing thumbs to a 'page of pages' tab will put the files in the next lowest selected media page</li>
					<li>DnDing thumbs to a blank notebook area (or a page of pages without a selected media page) will create a new page for the thumbs</li>
					<li>holding down ctrl when you drop thumbnails will not remove them from the source</li>
					<li>please forgive the thumbnail DnD cursor, which for now will be in the 'copy' state, despite the internal DnD being move by default</li>
					<li>improved page tab drag and drop drop logic--dropping onto the page area itself will no longer send the page to the right-end of the current notebook</li>
					<li>the 'file import options' object now supports three 'presentation' booleans--for new/already_in_inbox/already_in_archive files--so you can customise whether new thumbnails appear based on each state. page imports will by default show everything, while 'quieter' import queues like import folders and subscriptions will continue to just show only 'new' files in their files popup buttons. if you have a gui page with 10k+ items in its queue, try reducing the presentation to speed it up!</li>
					<li>all existing import queues will be updated when they are next loaded--but please note that for simplicity and safety they will all initialise to the 'quiet' presentation method, so if you have ongoing download pages in any of your gui sessions (including thread watchers!), they will only add 'new' thumbnails unless you edit them. I apologise for the inconvenience</li>
					<li>the regular hdd import now has a file import options button!</li>
					<li>subscription query 'finished' file popups are now merged up to the subscription level--so, a sub with five queries that each get 20 new files in a run will now ultimately leave one popup with 100 files</li>
					<li>file popups (as produced by subscriptions and a couple other places) now preserve their import order!</li>
					<li>if a subscription with many queries runs out of bandwidth, it should now only give you one 'no more bandwidth to download files' message, rather than one for every outstanding query to sync</li>
					<li>added a checkbox to turn on/off the new random subscription syncing to the options->downloading panel</li>
					<li>the file import status button's menu now supports import/export of sources to clipboard/png! it _should_ also support unicode. be careful not to paste paths into a url cache, or urls from one gallery site to another, or you'll just get errors--this is prototype, so please keep like with like for now</li>
					<li>the png import/export system now supports raw string payloads</li>
					<li>the new listctrlpanel can now hang its buttons in multiple rows</li>
					<li>the manage subscriptions panel now has an 'overwrite checker options' button to mass-set checker options</li>
					<li>the manage subscriptions panel now has a 'select subs' button that selects subs based on a basic query text search</li>
					<li>separating merged subscriptions now sets better new subscription names of 'old_sub_name: query_text'</li>
					<li>saving a session from a page of pages with a custom name will no longer suggest a session name prepended by [USER]</li>
					<li>doubled the subscription and downloader instance default bandwidth rules to 400 and 200 rqs/day</li>
					<li>the 'load_images_with_pil' and 'disable_cv_for_gifs' options are now officially BUGFIX in the options--unless you know you need them on, turn them off!</li>
					<li>added some safeguards to the new dialog-panel system's OK stuff, which sometimes catches a duplicate OK event</li>
					<li>shuffled some db update status texts around</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 286</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>simplified how thread watcher assigns DEAD and 404 status--it should do it more reliably now</li>
					<li>thread watchers now publish their page names (including updating dead/404 status) right after they check</li>
					<li>the save session menu under pages now lists the exsting sessions for quick-save--if you select one of these, it will throw up a yes/no overwrite confirmation dialog</li>
					<li>'appending' sessions now loads them in a new page of pages named as the session name!</li>
					<li>right-clicking on a page of pages now gives you a 'save this page of pages to a session' option</li>
					<li>right-clicking on the page tabs lets you append a session anywhere</li>
					<li>'load' session is now 'clear and load', and it throws a yes/no dialog for confirmation</li>
					<li>the gallery pending queries box now allows multiple selection with ctrl/shift clicks. it'll even move up/down correctly on non-contiguous selections!</li>
					<li>the gallery query input is now a new combined textctrl-and-paste button control that will appear in other places across the program</li>
					<li>the page of images input now also uses this new control</li>
					<li>the page of images and raw urls queues will now ignore any input that does not start with 'http'</li>
					<li>pasting a list of texts from the clipboard will now typically strip the pasted content of leading or trailing whitespace</li>
					<li>some text and tag cleaning is a bit faster and neater</li>
					<li>the file import status panel now supports 'open sources' on its right-click menu--it opens in your web browser or file explorer as appropriate. (linux can't do file explorer though)</li>
					<li>thumbnails will no longer 'fade' when their pages are not visible, reducing CPU load in several contexts</li>
					<li>thumbnail fade will use less CPU overhead on very fast computers</li>
					<li>the timer loops that all import pages use to keep themselves updated are now harmonised into one loop at the top gui level (this should reduce some idle CPU overhead and improve some ui responsiveness)</li>
					<li>content (tag and rating) shortcuts can now be set to 'flip on/off' or 'set'</li>
					<li>the manage subscriptions dialog now waits for any currently syncing subs to cancel and save themselves before opening itself (keeping it all synced and rollback-proof)</li>
					<li>added a 'watchable' url class type and wrote examples for 4chan/8chan thread urls</li>
					<li>added 4chan/8chan file url classes to the examples, which if added will auto-hide them from the media viewer</li>
					<li>fixed 'add parameter' in edit url match panel</li>
					<li>simplified some stuff in the existing parsing system</li>
					<li>added preliminary 'url type' support to the parsing system</li>
					<li>the html formula parsing object can now return the full child html of the node it finds</li>
					<li>the new url and html stuff doesn't do anything yet--but it will in the new downloader engine</li>
					<li>added a bunch more booru entries to the url classes defaults. I will continue filling these out, hopefully setting comprehensive defaults next week</li>
					<li>the advanced mode thumbnail right-click menu lets you reparse and regen thumbnails for any files! if you have rotated or stretched files, you can now fix them from the menu!</li>
					<li>added new tools to let the client update media file metadata and thumbnails live!</li>
					<li>the new reparse and regen should update file metadata and thumbnails live!</li>
					<li>improved how some 'quiet' errors are printed to the log. they'll now have the full trace of the error as well as the stack</li>
					<li>added a daemon_report_mode debug mode. it throws up a popup every time a daemon fires its callable</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the editstringtostringdictcontrol</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with loading (and updating to a new version) import pages or import folders with some kinds of unicode paths</li>
					<li>you can now set the 'woah, you should close some pages' warning value under options->gui. its default remains 165 pages</li>
					<li>system:similar_to searches should be a lot faster on clients with many files</li>
					<li>the manage subscriptions and edit subscription panels now both list their num_urls summary column as '22' if all done but '11/22' if not. this column also sorts based on percentage completion, then num total, then num done</li>
					<li>the database migration dialog now uses the new listctrl--its buttons are now also clever, and will disable when they are invalid</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
					<li>fixed an index bug in the new listctrl after certain types of 'setdata' call</li>
					<li>cleaned up some search code</li>
					<li>some veto code cleanup</li>
					<li>cleaned and harmonised how text is pulled from the clipboard</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 285</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added 'network' main gui menu and moved network stuff from services to it</li>
					<li>split the new domain manager stuff up into separate dialogs and menu entries on the new network menu</li>
					<li>manage url classes dialog now lists url type in the listctrl</li>
					<li>added url class links info (which will permit client-specific settings and downloader mappings for url classes) to the domain manager</li>
					<li>wrote a 'url class links' dialog and added it to the new network menu (only the 'display on media viewer' part works atm)</li>
					<li>the domain manager now filters urls on the media viewer depending on whether they have a url match and are set to display in the new links panel</li>
					<li>updated the local booru service code to the new service system</li>
					<li>the local booru's shares can be reviewed again under review services</li>
					<li>the local booru's port and bandwidth settings can be set again under manage services</li>
					<li>the different gui parts of the local booru are updated to new controls</li>
					<li>fixed a local booru 404 reporting error</li>
					<li>the edit subscription panel now has a 'paste queries' button that lets you add queries en masse</li>
					<li>added 'manage_file_urls' to shortcuts system</li>
					<li>added several 'get_similar_to_x' actions to the shortcuts system</li>
					<li>the manage upnp dialog now initialises its mappings on another thread and fails better when UpnP mappings cannot be fetched</li>
					<li>connection and readtimeout network exceptions are now recognised more specifically by the client. subscriptions will only delay for an hour on one of these exceptions</li>
					<li>improved the resilience of the HF login code after wake from sleep (when networking is often not available for a couple of seconds)</li>
					<li>like the recent subscription query randomisation update, subscriptions themselves are now synced in random order (this stops a subscription named 'aadvark' always getting first bite into available bandwidth)</li>
					<li>fixed import for jpegs that have unparsable exif data</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in 'next month' bandwidth estimate calculation when the month is December, wew</li>
					<li>fixed some logic that was setting max page at 165 rather than the intended 200 and added a dialog that even lets you engage the debug override at 200 if you are insane</li>
					<li>all audio mime detection and duration parsing is now done through ffmpeg. hsaudiotag is no longer needed to run the program</li>
					<li>since the old listctrl sort crash bug is still hitting some people, I've disabled sort on the old listctrl class. feel free to try to sort any listctrls now, no matter your situation. I will continue replacing the old class with the new working class over time</li>
					<li>updated another listctrl</li>
					<li>a ton of misc controller options/manager access refactoring</li>
					<li>cleared out some old code</li>
					<li>moved Time controls to their own file and added velocity and checker options stuff as well</li>
					<li>wrote a new edit panel for single controls and updated the time delta button to use it</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 284</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed subscription queries turning dead on the initial sync</li>
					<li>all dead subscription queries have been set to check again in case they can revive</li>
					<li>added query file velocity to edit subscription panel</li>
					<li>subscription network contexts now reflect the new multiple subscription query system, and are named "sub_name: query_text". as every query now counts as its own separate subscription network context, this will stop query-heavy subscriptions from throttling so much on bandwidth limits</li>
					<li>finished URLMatch object, which matches and normalises URLs into certain 'classes' like 'gelbooru post url'</li>
					<li>expanded some URLMatch subdomain options</li>
					<li>fixed some test logic in URLMatch</li>
					<li>finished the last of the EditURLMatchPanel</li>
					<li>split the 'manage network rules' dialog into two panels--it now has a 'url classes' tab</li>
					<li>wrote a panel for managing url matches</li>
					<li>added export/import/duplicate buttons to EditURLMatchesPanel</li>
					<li>wrote some URLMatches for hentai-foundry as an initial test of the system and added a temp button to add them--please check them out to see how it all works</li>
					<li>all, invert, inbox, and archive (and none, lol) thumbnail 'select' menu items now have counts</li>
					<li>invert is now at the bottom</li>
					<li>the thumbnail select menu now has local/remote entries if applicable (this typically is only true in 'all known files' file domain)</li>
					<li>added png/clipboard export/import/duplicate code to the generic new listctrl button wrapper panel, which will save a bunch of time as the png/clipboard sharing system expands</li>
					<li>added a human-facing serialisable name to all objects on the new serialisation system and tied the new import/export code into it for png presentation</li>
					<li>the edit import folder dialog will now complain (but not veto) on an ok event if any of the entered paths do not exist</li>
					<li>if you attempt to manually run an import folder while import folders are globally paused, you'll get a little popup telling you so</li>
					<li>added an experimental 'thumbnail fill' setting to options->gui. it zooms the existing thumbnails so they fill the whole thumb space. feedback on this from those who would be interested in a prettier system would be appreciated</li>
					<li>added 'paste tags' buttons to filename tagging options panel</li>
					<li>the paths/urls in the file import cache are now their own object that holds the creation/modified/source times and current status and note. this object can also hold prospective urls, tags, and hashes for future use</li>
					<li>a bunch of file import actions are faster</li>
					<li>all the different importers now use this new file import object</li>
					<li>fixed a screen position calculation in the new drag and drop filtering code that was accidentally including too many possible drop candidates on drops in the top-left corner of the main gui (if you had trouble moving tabs to the left, this should be it fixed!)</li>
					<li>fixed a problem display volume/chapter/page tags that included unicode characters in thumbnail banners and media viewers</li>
					<li>fixed a rare media display bug in the dupe filter</li>
					<li>fixed some 'C++ part of panel has been deleted' bugs in review services if the frame is shut down before delayed db info is fetched</li>
					<li>cleaned up some more 'C++ deleted' errors in import files selection dialog</li>
					<li>fixed the network context custom header panel 'add' action, which wasn't saving the value of the panel</li>
					<li>fixed a bunch of bugs in the newish QueueListBox class</li>
					<li>SynchroniseRepositories daemon will be better about quitting early on application shutdown</li>
					<li>cleaned up some pending pretty timestamp grammar</li>
					<li>when the client cannot clean up a temporary file, it will print more error information</li>
					<li>added pylzma to the 'running from source' library recommendations. this is not required, but if available it adds ZWS flash support</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 283</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>subscription popups show a bit more info about their individual queries</li>
					<li>subscription popups hide the sub-query info in text and file buttons if it is the same as the subscription name</li>
					<li>subscriptions now work through their queries' downloading phases in random order (so a heavy query named 'aardvark' won't repeatedly choke the sub's other queries if bandwidth is tight)</li>
					<li>if a subscription query dies, a notification popup will now be made</li>
					<li>changed a logical edge case that may have been killing some subscription queries after the first sync</li>
					<li>re-enabled pixiv artist search, as it still uses the old gallery style</li>
					<li>added tentative support for 'ZWS' flash files</li>
					<li>if there is more than one import folder, the 'check import folder now' submenu now has a 'check all' entry</li>
					<li>TimeDelta controls that have the 'days' entry (as in thread/subscription checker options panels) now have a max period of 10 years for those _really_ slow threads</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the 'quick namespaces' section of the new filename tagging options panel was not initialising correctly when it loaded data from a previously serialised import folder (this was the "unhashable type: 'list'" bug in the edit import folder panel)</li>
					<li>the filename tagging dialog now works on the new panel system. it also has an entry under options->gui: 'local_import_filename_tagging'</li>
					<li>polished StringMatch object</li>
					<li>polished EditStringMatchPanel</li>
					<li>html formulas now have a string match object</li>
					<li>improved parsing error system</li>
					<li>miscellaneous improvements to the parsing system</li>
					<li>misc fixes to StringMatch and parsing system</li>
					<li>the main gui will no longer interpret text drops on child frames as url drops. this fix just quashes the drop--it doesn't allow the initially desired drop on the child frame to occur. I will keep thinking about this</li>
					<li>the dupe filter's 'no media to display' text now says 'Looking for more pairs--please wait'</li>
					<li>the 'remove' media action is now labelled 'remove from view' to reduce 'is it a delete?' confusion</li>
					<li>fixed an icon initialisation order problem that meant pre-boot errors were unable to display</li>
					<li>fixed a graceful-shutdown-on-boot-error bug</li>
					<li>the custom 'listboxtags' controls now post an event on their contents changing</li>
					<li>the tag censorship panel now updates its status text when its listboxes change due to a mouse double-click event</li>
					<li>fixed file import 'source time' column sometimes showing '3e-05 years' kind of garbage that was due to a missed float->int conversion</li>
					<li>cleaned up how some page names are thrown around, which should stop some stray [USER] prefixes slipping though</li>
					<li>the adminside petition management checklistbox will now escape mnemonic characters (typically '&') and hence display them correctly on sibling pairs and so on</li>
					<li>wrote a 'help my client will not boot.txt' that explains the new debug builds and some other common fixes to try</li>
					<li>'all known files' file search domain is now hidden behind advanced mode</li>
					<li>fixed another instance of flashwin causing a failed boot</li>
					<li>cleaned up some old broken unit tests</li>
					<li>some misc help improvements</li>
					<li>updated Windows build to new version of sqlite</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 282</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>rolled back to an older version of pyinstaller that does not seem to have the embedded flash window problems windows users experienced</li>
					<li>added an error handler to wx.lib.flashwin import--if it fails to import, the client will print the error to the log and thereafter show 'open externally' buttons instead of the embedded flash window</li>
					<li>created a 'filename tagging options' object to handle the instance-non-specific auto-tagging parts of the filename tagging dialog</li>
					<li>moved all the appropriate tag generation code to this new object</li>
					<li>extracted the simple and advanced panels in the filename tagging dialog to a separate panel</li>
					<li>wrote a new wrapper panel to edit filename tagging options objects directly</li>
					<li>cleaned up some tag generation code--it'll now all be siblinged/parented/censored the same way</li>
					<li>import folders now use the filename tagging options object, harmonising this tag parsing code</li>
					<li>edit import folder gui now has an add/edit/delete listctrl to manage the new tag_service->filename_tagging_object relationship (this replaces the old .txt management button and summary text)</li>
					<li>finished the StringConverter class in the new parsing engine. it applies a series of transformations to text</li>
					<li>wrote a panel to edit string converters</li>
					<li>wrote a panel to edit string converters' individual transformations</li>
					<li>updated html formulas to use string converters instead of the old cull_and_add system</li>
					<li>html formula edit panels can now edit their new string converters</li>
					<li>file lookup scripts now 'stringconvert' their file identifier strings--this should allow the 'md5:md5_hash' fix we've been talking about (i.e. by first encoding to hex and then prepending 'md5:')</li>
					<li>the help->about window now shows the client's default temp directory</li>
					<li>thumbnail regeneration--particularly full-size regen and resized png gen--should be much faster in the client</li>
					<li>the debug exes are now included in the windows build</li>
					<li>the debug exes are now included in the non-windows builds</li>
					<li>the test exe is no longer included in the windows install (can't remember it ever being useful, and it is like 10MB now)</li>
					<li>unfortunately, a recentish change to how pixiv serves gallery page results has broken the hydrus pixiv downloader. this will have to wait for the downloader overhaul, and even then, it might be _slightly_ tricky. pixiv downloader entries are now hidden, and existing pixiv subscriptions will be paused on update</li>
					<li>the thumbnail select submenu now clarifies 'all (all in x)' if all are in the inbox or archive</li>
					<li>you can now archive/delete filter from the thumbnail menu on a single file</li>
					<li>lowered the http session inactivity timeout even more, to 45 minutes</li>
					<li>fixed a couple of instances of the new subscription dialogs being unable to mass-retry failures</li>
					<li>ffmpeg parsing errors now print more info about broken file path</li>
					<li>some daemons will be snappier about shutting down on application shutdown</li>
					<li>took out the sometimes invalid 'booting' phrase in the during disk cache population status report</li>
					<li>the client will now warn you about page instability at 165 pages after one user reported instability at 175. 200 is still the strict limit.</li>
					<li>downloader pages and subscriptions will fail more gracefully if their downloaders cannot be loaded (e.g. they used a since-deleted booru)</li>
					<li>fixed listctrl panel button enabled/disabled status when the child listctrl starts empty</li>
					<li>the new listctrl can now select data in a cleverer way</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 281</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>subscriptions can now support multiple queries!</li>
					<li>subscriptions now use the new thread checker system to set their check periods!</li>
					<li>improved some check timing calculations to deal with subscription timestamps</li>
					<li>existing subscriptions will update</li>
					<li>subscriptions can now see any 'delay' reason on their edit page and can scrub it there as well</li>
					<li>subscriptions no longer track 'last error'. everything goes through the delay system and keeps track of reason</li>
					<li>added 'last new file time' to the subscription listctrls</li>
					<li>subscriptions now generate separate 'file button' popups for each query, and file button popups now include their name in the button label</li>
					<li>the subscription listctrl is now breddy wide. I will be adding some way of hiding columns (with persistent memory) on the new listctrl at some point in the future, so please bear with it for now</li>
					<li>manage subs now has a wrapper panel and buttons that disable when invalid</li>
					<li>tumblr simple 'video' posts should now be supported! turns out they are just mp4s</li>
					<li>in the client, static image thumbnails are now generated with opencv</li>
					<li>files that give truncated image errors should now import ok. they'll render with errors. if cv is up to date and working ok, they should have good thumbnails as well (otherwise they will have all-black thumbs)</li>
					<li>updated manage regex favourites dialog to the new panel system</li>
					<li>regex favourites are now editable under the new options->regex page</li>
					<li>ongoing import or export folders will now stop working if their respective manage dialogs are opened</li>
					<li>import folders can now stop working if the client shuts down during the initial file parse phase</li>
					<li>export folders will now stop working immediately if the client shuts down</li>
					<li>export folders can now stop working during the file copy stage</li>
					<li>the splash screen is now a little wider and taller</li>
					<li>the splash screen now has a subtext row for misc technical data</li>
					<li>the boot and exit splash screens show a bit more data about several things</li>
					<li>the repository sync daemons should be a bit snappier about responding to a client shutdown</li>
					<li>the import files dialog is now a non-modal frame! (you can now continue to use the client while this frame parses files) you can even open up several at once!</li>
					<li>the 'import file path tagging' dialog should now never be taller than its spawning screen and also slide up and left if it spawns with its bottom-right corner off-screen (this dialog is still on the old system, however, so the newer sizing stuff that does this stuff automatically is not yet available)</li>
					<li>sliding up-and-left should now also occur on spawn for frames on the new system</li>
					<li>the advanced 'process now' repository button will now disable itself if there is no work to do!</li>
					<li>if simple downloads like gallery pages are larger than 100MB, the client will throw an error (this is a stopgap for an ongoing issue)</li>
					<li>the 'maintenance and processing' page has a bit more warning text</li>
					<li>the new listctrl wrapper panel now supports menu buttons</li>
					<li>libpng's iccp terminal warnings from loading the flash/pdf/zip thumbnails should now be gone!</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 280</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the client should now recognise EXIF file rotation and flipping in resolution discovery, thumbnail generation, and image rendering. existing files will be borked, so will have to either be manually deleted&reimported, or wait for a maintenance routine that will retroactively fix all these</li>
					<li>videos with a non 1:1 sample aspect ratio (wew lad) should now import with correct resolutions</li>
					<li>all 'tag import options' are now managed with the new button</li>
					<li>deleted all old tag option management gui, including deleting ClientGUICollapsible entirely</li>
					<li>with the simpler tag import options, increased max page count to 200</li>
					<li>page of images downloader now has two pause separate buttons for queue and files processing</li>
					<li>the page of images downloader should no longer too-quickly blank out its parser status at the end of queue processing</li>
					<li>the default hydrus bandwidth rules now no longer has the choking 'requests per day' limitation that was messing up large mappings uploads. (it is now just 64MB/day)</li>
					<li>your hydrus default bandwidth rules will reset to this on update</li>
					<li>POST requests (which in for our purposes are always user-driven) no longer obey bandwidth rules</li>
					<li>fixed a bug when sometimes hitting the file limit or hitting a siteside 404 in the gallery downloader</li>
					<li>a rare bug due to empty string menu labels is now no longer possible. empty string labels, if they slip through, will be replaced with 'invalid label'</li>
					<li>you can no longer choose the empty string as a gui session name</li>
					<li>improved how network jobs keep track of all applicable network contexts vs the preferred session and login contexts</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of login code, improved verification testing</li>
					<li>fleshed out domain login system</li>
					<li>in the networking engine, the read timeout is now six times the connect timeout--we'll see if this reduces some hydrus and other read timeout problems we've seen</li>
					<li>increased the server transaction period from 10s to 120s--we'll see if this helps reduce some spiky server POST lag or what</li>
					<li>the default tag import options panel now edits on double-click, rather than deletes. it also yes/no dialogs on a delete action. this control is still trash, but it now works more like the rest of the program</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 279</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>moved the hydrus service object over to the new networking engine</li>
					<li>hydrus services now appear in the bandwidth review panel</li>
					<li>hydrus requests now obey larger network bandwidth rules (this mostly means 'global')</li>
					<li>service bandwidth usage and rules are no longer managed from manage services--it is now under review bandwidth usage, like all other network contexts</li>
					<li>updated some network engine stuff for misc hydrus states like 'server busy'</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in the server code where the session key cookie had an invalid expiration timestamp--servers should update this week to make sure new clients can log in properly</li>
					<li>hydrus network requests will force-set User-Agent as 'hydrus client/(network_version)' as the network version is used in the protocol to determine compatibility</li>
					<li>fleshed out the hydrus specific network job, giving it the various bandwidth tracking and version checking responsibilities the service object used to have</li>
					<li>moved session cookie decay (only matters for Hentai Foundry atm) to the new session manager (was previously hacked into the login manager)</li>
					<li>moved some hydrus response parsing stuff around, added content type awareness to the new network job</li>
					<li>updated several unusual hydrus 'static/test' requests used to test credentials and fetch access key and so on to the new system</li>
					<li>added a special 'test service' service to better accomodate these requests</li>
					<li>wrote a static login script for hydrus services</li>
					<li>polished up login management system overall</li>
					<li>import folders now support a 'check now' state, like subscriptions, that will cause them to check immediately</li>
					<li>import folders can be 'check now'ed from the file menu under a new submenu! if you would like to have a 'manual' import folder, try pausing it and just running it from this menu!</li>
					<li>added an optimisation to the file search algorithm to search ratings queries super fast when they lack tag or file system preds to otherwise speed them up</li>
					<li>updated the booru presets that now support https to be https</li>
					<li>added a 'restore defaults' button to the manage boorus dialog--you can restore specifics or all of them</li>
					<li>optimised how fading thumbnails are blitted to screen, which may provide a huge performance boost for high-res/small-thumb clients</li>
					<li>pages that have been renamed by the user will no longer be rename-overwritten by any auto-renaming system (currently just thread watchers, I think, but this will expand in future). unfortunately, this is not retroactive--only pages renamed from now on will be aware that they were user-renamed</li>
					<li>in advanced mode, the pages menu now states how many pages are currently open</li>
					<li>the 'page of images' downloader will now say '(x already in queue)' when it reports how many urls were found, if any were already in the queue. (this should clear up some confusion where it would previously say '0 new urls' even when it found some stuff)</li>
					<li>the gallery downloader will do essentially the same, but on a per-page basis. the text is a little crushed, so I may revisit this</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the manage services dialog not being able to rename dupe-named services on edit subdialog ok</li>
					<li>the manage services dialog now uses the new listctrl! the listed services are no longer a horrific unsorted mess!</li>
					<li>fixed the file import status button not showing on raw url downloader or import folder edit dialog</li>
					<li>improved how some directory tree merging code deals with read_only files in the source</li>
					<li>maybe fixed some unusual selection behaviour with the booru selection popup dialog. it now has a real ok button, rather than a mickey-mouse hidden one</li>
					<li>completely deleted the old networking engine!</li>
					<li>cleaned out some unused imports from the networking code and related entries from running_from_source.html</li>
					<li>changed up and fixed some odd bugs in how how repositories test some error/isfunctional stuff vs regular paused status</li>
					<li>hydrus network contexts now have a prettier name</li>
					<li>ip address-based network contexts will no longer spam the bandwidth tracker with their useless subdomains</li>
					<li>network jobs that are unable to attempt validation or login will now error immediately rather than waiting indefinitely</li>
					<li>fixed up a bunch of test code that was broken due to the mismatch of network engines</li>
					<li>broke some other test code due to the network engine transfer!</li>
					<li>the client is more resilient about broken 'twisted' installs, and _should_ be able to boot without it. this may or may not apply to the built release--more work can be done here</li>
					<li>some network job refactoring</li>
					<li>clientside service code cleanup</li>
					<li>misc fix that I can't remember</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 278</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed the tumblr raw url converter to now point to the data.tumblr.com domain</li>
					<li>added a hardcoded ssl verify exception for data.tumblr.com, which has an incorrectly defined ssl cert (at least for public-facing interactions), wew</li>
					<li>all existing db urls and file import cache urls for media.tumblr.com will be updated to data.tumblr.com on update! (everything _should_ just magically work again)</li>
					<li>fixed apng import, which the decompressionbomb detection code was not handling correctly</li>
					<li>collapsed the different instatiations of the 'file import status' button down to one class</li>
					<li>the file import status button now has a right-click menu that supports 'retry failures' and 'delete processed', if applicable</li>
					<li>misc import status cache cleanup and refactoring</li>
					<li>you can now edit or completely turn off the [404] and [DEAD] thread watcher page name prefixes under options->downloading</li>
					<li>thread watchers should more reliably keep 404 status</li>
					<li>'open selection in a new page' now preserves file order!</li>
					<li>'view this file's duplicates' now sorts the files!</li>
					<li>options->gui now has an option to change how often 'last session' is saved</li>
					<li>'last session' will no longer autosave to the database if there are no changes</li>
					<li>tags exported to neighbouring .txt files are now correctly sibling-collapsed</li>
					<li>tags imported or exported via neighbouring .txt files are now correctly tag censored</li>
					<li>the manage tags dialog will now protest with a yes/no dialog if you attempt to cancel it with uncommitted changes</li>
					<li>the manage parents and siblings dialogs will now protest with a yes/no on an ok event if there are 'uncommitted' pairs in the lower boxes (e.g. if you forgot to click the 'add' button)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue that would sometimes stop old sessions from loading properly</li>
					<li>the duplicates page now does its maintenance jobs in modal popups!</li>
					<li>attempting to apply a duplicate status to more than 100 pairs now throws up a warning yes/no dialog</li>

					<li>added a (somewhat debug) option to disable the mouse hide&anchor behaviour on slow Windows canvas drags to options->media</li>
					<li>added a 'regen all phashes' command to the database regen menu</li>
					<li>the disk cache options in help now have a help button to explain good values for ssd vs hdd</li>

					<li>misc login work</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 277</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>expanded the domain manager into a legit serialisable object that holds data and saves itself on changes. to begin with, it supports custom http headers for particular on network contexts</li>
					<li>the global User-Agent (which now defaults to 'hydrus client') is set through this new manager, as attached to the 'global' network context</li>
					<li>wrote a basic panel to edit custom http headers under services->manage network rules (this panel will be fleshed out with more in future--please ignore if you are not an advanced user)</li>
					<li>wrote a panel to edit an individual custom http header</li>
					<li>wrote a panel to edit/select network contexts. this will get a bunch more use elsewhere as the overhaul continues</li>
					<li>flushed out and tested the new popup yes/no button system</li>
					<li>sanakucomplex.com has a User-Agent entry in the new custom header system--on the first sank request, you will be presented with a yes/no popup asking if it is ok to use.</li>
					<li>if you ok the user-agent, sankaku now seems to work again!</li>
					<li>sankakucomplex.com network context will get some specific conservative bandwidth rules (80 rqs per 7m, 1 rq per 4s) on update</li>
					<li>added an option to options->gui to reverse the page tab shift behaviour</li>
					<li>'don't scroll down on key navigation event if thumb is at least this % visible' value is now 75%. it is also editable under options->gui</li>
					<li>the hydrus icon used on frames is now the non-transparent version that shows up better on dark backgrounds</li>
					<li>the standard hydrus.ico used in web favicons and the executable builds is now also non-transparent (this should also propagate up to OS shortcuts and taskbar icons wherever the frame icon is not inherited)</li>
					<li>file export drag and drop events will now defocus the currently focused media on successful drop (e.g. if you drag a video to an external media player, it will stop rendering clientside), just like for open externally</li>
					<li>database analyze maintenance should be more reliable with respect to fresh repository syncs</li>
					<li>reduced default impermanent session timeout in new networking engine to 60m (should fix/reduce some hentai foundry 503s)</li>
					<li>misc ui improvements and speedup</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 276</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the new thread watcher object will no longer produce check periods shorter than the time since the latest file. this effectively throttles checking on threads that were posting very fast but have since suddenly stopped completely</li>
					<li>thread watchers now parse their thread subject and place this in the left management panel</li>
					<li>thread watchers now name their pages based on the thread subject, if one exists</li>
					<li>an option to permit or deny thread watchers renaming their pages is now under options->downloading</li>
					<li>dead and 404 threads now disable their checker pause button--to attempt to revive, hit 'check now'</li>
					<li>thread watchers now preface their page name with [DEAD] or [404] when appropriate</li>
					<li>misc thread watcher code improvements</li>
					<li>added basic import support for zip, rar, and 7z files. they get no useful metadata (yet) and have a default 'archive' thumbnail</li>
					<li>the client will now by default detect and not import decompression bombs before they blat your computer. an option to allow them nonetheless is under options->media</li>
					<li>the server will now not parse or accept decompression bomb uploads in POST requests</li>
					<li>added a 'refresh all pages' entry to page of pages's right-click menu</li>
					<li>added 'send this page down to a new page of pages' to page right-click menu</li>
					<li>added 'send all pages to the right to a new page of pages' to page right-click menu</li>
					<li>fixed a page of pages drag and drop issue when dropping the last page of a notebook onto the same notebook tab</li>
					<li>fixed some index calculation problems when DnDing page tabs to the right on the same notebook</li>
					<li>sending a refresh event to a 'show selection in a new page' page (which has no search predicates and so cannot 'refresh' its search) will now trigger a sort event (like importers got last week)</li>
					<li>thumbnails at the bottom of the current view but are at least 90% in view will no longer scroll into view when selected</li>
					<li>click events will no longer scroll thumbnails that are semi-out of view into view</li>
					<li>improved how all 'wait until the client ain't so busy' checks work. importers that have a whole slew of 'already in db' to catch up on should now not clog the gui so much</li>
					<li>similarly, under ideal conditions where nothing is busy, importers will iterate over their files more quickly</li>
					<li>the network engine now has a 'verification' loop that doesn't do anything yet, and a stub domain engine is generated to be consulted in this</li>
					<li>wrote some verification code, extended popup messages to support yes/no questions</li>
					<li>polished some domain engine code</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where file repositories were not recording deleted files in certain cases</li>
					<li>all file repositories will be reset on update</li>
					<li>the date entries on the review bandwidth bar chart now have leading zeroes on 0-9 months to ensure the sort correctly (this month's 2017-10 entry was sorting before 2017-8, wew!)</li>
					<li>the migrate database dialog now shows approximate total thumbnail size</li>
					<li>gave the migrate database help a quick pass</li>
					<li>gave the 'help my db is broke.txt' file a quick pass</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 275</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>if you hold shift down while dropping a page tab, the client will not 'chase' that page to show it (try it out!)</li>
					<li>the gui will be more snappy about dealing with drag-and-drop drops (of types file import, page tab rearrange, and url drop), returning the mouse to normal state instantly on drop and dealing with the event in a subsequent action</li>
					<li>dropping url text on the client will specifically inform the source program not to delete the dragged text (that the operation was copy, not move), if it is interested in hearing that</li>
					<li>page drag-and-drops should transition a little less flickerily</li>
					<li>all file import status objects can now track 'source time', typically to represent upload time</li>
					<li>file imports now populate 'source time' based on the earliest of creation/modified time! (this will be used later to parse as a tag)</li>
					<li>thread watchers now populate 'source time' based on post time!</li>
					<li>finished a watcher options object for the new thread checker system</li>
					<li>wrote a panel to edit watcher options</li>
					<li>converted the thread object to the new watcher system</li>
					<li>thread watchers now have two pause buttons--one for the file queue, one for the checker</li>
					<li>compressed thread watcher ui layout</li>
					<li>converted the thread left-panel ui and options->downloading page to reflect the new watcher system</li>
					<li>improved the watcher options to generate better timings for fresh threads</li>
					<li>cleaned up some thread watcher check time code</li>
					<li>the total/selected mime summary on the status bar is a little prettier and will now report by individual mime sometimes</li>
					<li>generating the total/select mime summaries are now faster on pages with >1,000 files (it'll just use 'file')</li>
					<li>a 'refresh' action on an import page now triggers a sort event</li>
					<li>added 'flip_darkmode' shortcut command to 'main_gui' and 'media_viewer' shortcut sets</li>
					<li>added copy_file/path/hash/bmp actions to the 'media' shortcut set, removed the hardcoded ctrl+c for copy_file. I added ctrl+c to the defaults, but existing users will have to re-add it manually if they want it!</li>
					<li>simplified some page ui update code</li>
					<li>import pages will no longer update their left-panel ui (which uses a bit of cpu) when they are not in view</li>
					<li>polished some new string and url matching code the domain engine will be using</li>
					<li>wrote a panel to edit string match objects</li>
					<li>wrote a new panel to handle simple ordered lists of data in a better way</li>
					<li>wrote most of a panel to edit url match objects</li>
					<li>misc domain manager work</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with the old listctrl where object name de-duplication was sometimes not permitting (1)-type names to be cleaned up</li>
					<li>fixed some inelegant time duration->text conversions</li>
					<li>improved complete process shutdown reliability when some downloads are waiting on bandwidth on shutdown</li>
					<li>did some misc listctrl update work</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 274</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the help menu now has an easy on/off check entry for the darkmode colourset</li>
					<li>changing any individual colour or the entire colourset will now immediately refresh almost all custom-coloured controls with the new colour</li>
					<li>added a BUGFIX option to options->gui to permanently fix all discord file drag-and-drop events (as long as they contain <= 10 files and total < 50MB)</li>
					<li>you can now set specific 'open externally' launch paths on a per-mime basis under options->files and trash</li>
					<li>improved error reporting on a bad file launch</li>
					<li>improved the network engine to recover from and reattempt in-progress response read errors (previously reported as ReadTimeout)</li>
					<li>fixed the 'scroll to focused thumbnail' calculations on key events (when hitting up/down arrow key on thumbnail grid, the page wasn't scrolling correctly as needed)</li>
					<li>known urls no longer display with the scheme (http or https) in the media viewer top-right summary</li>
					<li>known urls in the media viewer top-right summary now tooltip their full url</li>
					<li>wrote a new button for editing tag import options. it has a good summary tooltip. it is only in the manage import folder dialog atm, but I will replicate it across the rest of the program in the coming weeks</li>
					<li>in some situations, the file import status window will list some timestamp note info for 'already in db' and 'deleted' statuses. see if you like it</li>
					<li>the new listctrl will generally give its data to other consumers in ui sorted order (this fixes some stuff like 'copy sources' in the file import status window, which was copying them in random order)</li>
					<li>manage tag parents now uses the new listctrl (and is hence now safely sortable)</li>
					<li>manage tag sibings now uses the new listctrl (and is hence now safely sortable)</li>
					<li>some behind-the-scenes of manage parents/siblings is a bit neater</li>
					<li>improved some thumbnail internal media structures to fetch specific media based on hash much much faster, particularly for pages with 10,000+ thumbs. this should speed up large imports and other content update events that can result in thumb redraws</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where dismissing a popup message could spawn the entire result of the queue, ignoring the 'show 10 max' rule</li>
					<li>completely finished the menu rewrite! all menus now work on the new system</li>
					<li>deleted a ton of old and now obselete menu event processing code</li>
					<li>some boot/shutdown terminal printing should be more reliable</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 273</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>converted the gui colour options to the new options system</li>
					<li>added a 'darkmode' colour set and extended the colour options page to support it!</li>
					<li>added a secret discord-compatible drag and drop mode. start a file transfer drag and drop with ctrl held down to initiate. keep ctrl held down, as this is secretly a 'move' drag and drop, and you want to keep it a 'copy' one. it should work for discord dnd, at least to the web version. I have an idea on how to do this better, but feedback on this would be appreciated.</li>
					<li>converted 'import options - files' collapsible panel to a button that launches a dialog. this reduces total gui object count when many importers are open and reduces overall ui lag and limits. the button shows a summary of its current options as its tooltip. furthermore, all of this sometimes confusing nomenclature is now uniformly presented as 'file import options'</li>
					<li>added a BUGFIX option to gui options page to force hover windows to display at all times</li>
					<li>improved last week's gelbooru 404 fix--page urls generated pre-v272 should now be more reliable</li>
					<li>in a further attempt to improve workspace support, popup messages will no longer update in any way if the mouse is not on the same display as the main gui</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where dupe import urls could be queued up in a file import queue if they came in the same batch. this was essentially harmless but lead to some mixed x/y progress counts and row indices</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where url drops were not filling in the url entry when a new raw url page had to be created on a currently selected page of pages. this may have affected a couple of other page spawning situations</li>
					<li>may have fixed an issue with the mouse shortcut-setting button, where for some users scroll events were not registering</li>
					<li>manage subs dialog now has the new help button up top</li>
					<li>manage subs dialog's sub verbs are now wrapping into a single menu button that I can expand more easily in future</li>
					<li>sped up thumbnail access a bit on certain well-defragged hard disk drives</li>
					<li>made thumbnail fading a little smoother in some situations</li>
					<li>rendered images that aren't otherwise pushing any memory limits will now stay cached for less time (10 mins) while thumbnails will hang around for longer (24 hours)--this was previously 20 mins for both. you should now see less thumbnail page 'refreshing' after returning to the client after inactivity</li>
					<li>sketched out basic classes for login and domain engines</li>
					<li>sketched out basic class for url matching</li>
					<li>sketched out basic classes for matching and transforming strings in certain login/domain situations</li>
					<li>updated the manage export folders dialog's listctrl to the new control</li>
					<li>updated the last media viewer menu code to the new system</li>
					<li>removed some old proxy code that was sometimes intruding on the new networking engine. proper proxy support will come in a later version</li>
					<li>fixed some test code</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 272</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>finished moving the last misc network consumers to the new networking engine</li>
					<li>greatly simplified and harmonised some of the new network job response processing</li>
					<li>the gelbooru 404 issue should be fixed!</li>
					<li>added a parsing patch for rule34hentai.net's mp4 links, which was causing 'link not found' failures on the hydrus parsing end. please tell your R34 subs to retry their fails</li>
					<li>wrote a patch (actually updated an existing patch that had fallen to bitrot) for the danbooru booru (and extended it to anything else with 'Running Danbooru' in its html) to try to fetch the full-size image if one exists. this may not last long, so I do not recommend regular users rely on it, but feel free to play with it until I have a better fix in the new downloader engine</li>
					<li>you can now add 'thread watcher' to the default import tag options. it has 'filename' and explicit tags options. unlike gallery downloaders, thread watchers will not inherit from the 'default' import tag options entry--you need to set the specific entry</li>
					<li>added regular number key support to the new shortcut system</li>
					<li>fixed the borked splash screen drag coordinate calculation</li>
					<li>heavy session loads should be more polite to CPUs and window managers</li>
					<li>pages should generally spawn with their proper name (rather than a flicker of 'page') no matter their spawning context</li>
					<li>fixed osx page tab drag-and-drop coordinate calculations</li>
					<li>figured a way to make os x page tab drag-and-drop start on a single left-mouse-down event</li>
					<li>in an effort to improve popup display on systems with virtual desktops, the popup message parent window will now not go from hidden to shown while the mouse is on a display screen other than the main gui</li>
					<li>fixed a wacky bug where clicking on a page tab, then on its sort dropdown, then on a different tab, would invoke the Deep Ones to commence a page tab drag and drop event</li>
					<li>fixed an index issue when unclosing some pages in certain orders</li>
					<li>increased pre-processing disk cache population time</li>
					<li>tweaked regular memory maintenance disk cache population timings</li>
					<li>fixed shortcut-driven tag petition events when the tag has a sibling (e.g. if you have sibling pair (a->b) and a shortcut (key->flip a), hitting 'key' will now correctly flip a (appearing as b) on and off in the media viewer)</li>
					<li>fixed some ugly layout sizing calculations on the path tagging dialog</li>
					<li>updated the path tagging listctrl to the new control</li>
					<li>updated the quick namespaces listctrl to the new control</li>
					<li>updated the regexbutton's menu to the new menu system</li>
					<li>fixed some typo errors with the regexbutton's entries!</li>
					<li>removed the old gallery downloader unit tests, as these operated on the old network and downloader engine--new, granular tests will be reintroduced for the new parsing components as they are written</li>
					<li>cleaned up some shortcut key code</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 271</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed an issue where the notebook 'motion' event was being consumed, disallowing the regular OS 'highlighting' on tab mouseover</li>
					<li>fixed page tab drag and drop crash for Linux</li>
					<li>fixed page tab drag and drop coordinate calculation for OS X</li>
					<li>page tab drag and drop should now work for all platforms</li>
					<li>new 'page of pages' pages now start with a blank file search page</li>
					<li>fixed several issues with row display in the new listctrl</li>
					<li>added a # index column to the file import status window, so you can resort the 'to be imported' order reliably</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the 'delete_file' application command was not firing on an appropriately mapped shortcut</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where automatic bandwidth override would only fire if its page was in view. it now occurs at all times</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the file import status frame, as launched from manage subscriptions, would sometimes be non-responsive (typically for Linux)</li>
					<li>fixed the 'pattern shortcuts' button on the export files dialog, which was misbehaving for certain choices for some window managers</li>
					<li>fixed an unusual error where middle-clicking to create a new page while a menu was open would lock the application from receiving new key/mouse events until program focus was lost, wew lad</li>
					<li>updated some old network code to the new engine</li>
					<li>added some delay to network connection error reattempts so that instant fails due to local network disconnect (e.g. while computer is waking from sleep) do not consume all the reattempts too quickly</li>
					<li>greatly simplified low-time-delta bandwidth testing and reporting, improving essential accuracy and overall feel</li>
					<li>gallery download errors will now print additional info to the log--let's see if we can gather more info on the gelbooru 404s</li>
					<li>wrote a patch for users of 2.X opencv who were running from source, who were unable to boot</li>
					<li>due to hardware failure, had to make a new Linux build computer. some libraries are updated, but build _should_ be the same--let me know if not</li>
					<li>updated to opencv 3.3 for all releases</li>
					<li>misc old menu code updates</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 270</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added page tab drag and drop (windows only, have to iron out critical bugs for linux/os x).</li>
					<li>dragging onto the middle of a normal tab will put the source tab there</li>
					<li>dragging onto the edge of a tab will try to insert the tab there</li>
					<li>dragging onto the middle of a page of pages tab will insert the tab onto the end of that page's list</li>
					<li>dragging a page up a notebook level will work ok</li>
					<li>dragging a notebook into itself will do nothing and not crash the client :^)</li>
					<li>new pages that come from the main gui level (such as from pages menu or file import) now open in the deepest open notebook (previously, they would always appear in the top row)</li>
					<li>fixed some misc page of pages bugs</li>
					<li>fixed a bandwidth calculation that meant 1s time delta rules were working at 50% capacity (e.g. 1rq per 1s rule for domains were actually running at 1rq per 2s)</li>
					<li>improved a bandwidth estimate calculation that was cutting out early in some situations for large time deltas</li>
					<li>tag manager's page up/down shortcuts no longer mistakenly navigate the archive/delete filter</li>
					<li>added a network timeout option to the 'connection' options page</li>
					<li>reduced some hover window show/hide flicker when the media viewer is fullscreen and the OS has a taskbar that pops in for non-fullscreen windows (this mostly affected Linux)</li>
					<li>fixed a long-time issue with yes/no dialog layout</li>
					<li>improved some rendering of EXIF-rotated and -flipped jpegs. I expect to add more support for this (and retroactive image metadata-parsing to figure out correct reversed resolution--atm rotated images remain stretched) in the coming weeks</li>
					<li>fixed an error when cancelling the booru-picker dialog from the page chooser dialog</li>
					<li>if no files or all files are selected, the 'invert' select choice will no longer be shown (in this case, it redundantly does the same job as 'all' and 'none')</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where setting namespace sort as default would persist through a client reboot</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where force idle debug mode was not waking sleeping daemons</li>
					<li>increased frequency of mappings processing reporting</li>
					<li>wrote an exception and the needed maintenance code for the 'repairfilesystem' dialog to allow a proceed action if the only remaining incorrect paths are thumbnail paths--in this case, the client will create empty prefix folders and prompt the user to regen thumbnails</li>
					<li>export filenames are now clipped to make <255 total characters in path</li>
					<li>removed the old 'processing phase' option, which was no longer in use</li>
					<li>removed the proxy settings from the 'connection' options page--the new engine does not use this old system, but if there is demand, a more flexible system will return</li>
					<li>misc image rendering pipeline updates</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 269</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>nested pages now supported!</li>

					<li>expanded the session object to hold nested page information</li>
					<li>added a 'page of pages' page to the 'special' new page entry!</li>
					<li>numerous other gui-notebook page-related event fixes and improvements</li>
					<li>figured out cross-platform menu and other mouse event support for nested notebooks, but there may still be holes--please let me know if your new pages ever appear in the wrong tier!</li>
					<li>ways to move pages up and down rows will come in the coming weeks!</li>
					<li>main gui status bar now shows total bandwidth this session as well as current speed</li>

					<li>added a button to reset 'default' and 'global' bandwidth rules to review bandwidth panel</li>
					<li>merged the network request start test and consumption code into one transaction, stopping some accidental overconsumption when the engine was under heavy load</li>
					<li>did some logic work to make sure unusual network context rule/usage situations are visible on the review bandwidth panel for editing</li>
					<li>network jobs now report more information as they get ready to start, including while they are held up waiting for a download slot</li>
					<li>added a simple 'network profile mode' to the debug menu that atm just prints a summary of new jobs</li>
					<li>fixed an error that could sometimes be a crash when 'review services' was opened while no pages were open in the main gui</li>
					<li>fixed the pixiv login test button with a hacky workaround--I will make extensive proper login testing gui when I move to the login engine</li>
					<li>fixed an issue in the youtube downloader</li>
					<li>if the bandwidth or session managers are missing on boot, empty defaults will be created in their stead</li>
					<li>bumped the max page limit up to 150--I expect to increase it more in the coming months as I rejigger how some gui stuff is laid out</li>
					<li>renamed 'sort by age' to 'time imported'</li>
					<li>fixed and improved some test code</li>
					<li>cleaned up some shutdown code</li>
					<li>should have fixed a rare unicode conversion issue when printing to log</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>split the sort dropdown into two, splitting the sort type and sort order</li>
					<li>file sorting works more intelligently behind the scenes in several ways</li>
					<li>added 'sort by number of tags' to sort options</li>
					<li>session pages now remember their sort status!</li>
					<li>sessions also more reliably remember their actual thumbnail order for all pages (typically, this matters for importers atm)</li>
					<li>network job controls now report an estimate of how long they will have to wait for bandwidth</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now show some 'no more bandwidth to download files' text if they have to stop because of bandwidth rules</li>
					<li>subscription 'should I start/continue' testing now has a little padding to forestall some potential unexpected long delays in operation due to edge cases</li>
					<li>the edit subscription dialog now uses the new file import status control</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with hentai foundry filters not applying (they added some categories since the downloader last worked, breaking the POST form), hence hiding most non-vanilla results</li>
					<li>finished the 'database->migrate database' dialog and its help and removed the 'under construction' labels. the new help page is also now linked from the standard index.html</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where pages would sometimes never initialise (due to being queued up after an infinite job like the network engine's mainloop!)</li>
					<li>improved how all long-job threads are spawned</li>
					<li>improved some more thread scheduling logic that meant some long-term jobs could be stacked undesirably</li>
					<li>expanded how the new listctrl updates and deletes its data</li>
					<li>reduced flicker on the new listctrl update events</li>
					<li>the file import status window now uses the new listctrl</li>
					<li>the manage subscriptions dialog now uses the new listctrl</li>
					<li>collections now track their tags more accurately</li>
					<li>moved the 'delete original files after success' checkbox up to reduce misclicks on ok'ing the file import dialog and added a bit of red warning text whenever it is on</li>
					<li>sped up some behind-the-scenes content processing for large pages</li>
					<li>improved how the program cleans some things up during exit</li>
					<li>the issue with some clients not clearing their exit splash screen until a mouseover event should be fixed</li>
					<li>at 120 open pages, the client will inform the user about the approaching max page limit</li>
					<li>by default, import folders no longer delete anything. default is to ignore original files in all cases</li>
					<li>deleted some old unusued code</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 267</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>drag-and-dropping a 4chan or 8chan url onto the client will now automatically open a thread watcher for that url</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where web domain or subscription network contexts that included unicode characters in their context data were unable to serialise and save to the db, causing error spam when the bandwidth manager attempted to save itself</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now show a network job control in their popup as they do network work</li>
					<li>subscriptions will cancel more reliably during gallery parse</li>
					<li>subscriptions now have some 'delay' logic that will stop them sometimes restarting as soon as they are cancelled or otherwise have to stop mid-work</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now tolerate up to five 'already in cache' urls per page parse until it considers the page 'already seen'. this is to catch the odd additional late insert and avoid the problem of a page updating and shuffling everything up one as the subscription walks through pages</li>
					<li>maintenance modal popup messages should no longer appear if their jobs are very quick</li>
					<li>queued up modal popup messages will no longer flicker their dialogs on a de-minimise</li>
					<li>should have fixed an issue where modal popup messages could sometimes error out on a close attempt, locking the client's whole gui and requiring a force quit</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the modal popup message dialog was OKing on a close attempt of a non-cancellable job, despite presenting user text indicating otherwise</li>
					<li>did a bunch of data work on pages</li>
					<li>page tab names will now be clipped to 20 characters by default</li>
					<li>pages now show (num_files) after their name by default, although you can set this for only import pages or turn it off completely</li>
					<li>options for these new behaviours are in options->gui--and page names will update immediately on dialog ok</li>
					<li>subscription and import folder 'show files' events (and a couple of other misc occasions) will now launch their page tab with the sub/folder name rather than a flat 'files'</li>
					<li>wrote a new listctrl class with custom sort code that does not suffer from the 'crash when sorted while many pages open' bug. it also handles data in a simpler way for hydrus</li>
					<li>review bandwidth listctrl now uses this new class and should now not crash your client. I will replace all the other listctrls with the new class over the coming weeks</li>
					<li>temporarily, no old listctrls will auto-sort themselves (as this causes a crash for many users)! if you do not suffer from the crash, please sort them yourselves for now</li>
					<li>reduced some large-scale gui import lag:</li>
					<li>reduced content processing CPU load on clients with many thumbnails open</li>
					<li>massively reduced content processing CPU load on non-current pages</li>
					<li>offloaded newly-imported file thumbnail detection and generation to a non-gui thread</li>
					<li>migrate database dialog now lets you move the whole database and all portable locations, which requires a client shutdown</li>
					<li>the raw url downloader will no longer have a problem with pasted url lists that include empty newlines</li>
					<li>all the downloaders/importers now sleep on cleverer event objects so they will burn less idle cpu and wake as soon as they have new work to do</li>
					<li>fixed and otherwise improved some gallery downloader timing logic</li>
					<li>hdd import pages now use the file import status control</li>
					<li>the thread watcher's controls now try to wrap in a single sizer. it uses less space, but might sperg out, let me know if it is a problem. I'll replace the whole watcher timing system in the new engine anyway</li>
					<li>fixed a gelbooru (and possibly others) booru parsing bug that meant half of the pages in the gallery walk were being skipped (e.g. 'mogudan' was producing ~350 files when there were actually 690 in the list)</li>
					<li>fixed some dialog panel layout scrollbar-cutoff in sevaral Linux places and perhaps elsewhere</li>
					<li>cleaned debug menu a little and added a save 'last session' entry</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where some kinds of media would error on notification of new url association</li>
					<li>clients will now save small transaction progress reliably within ten seconds no matter how idle they are</li>
					<li>deleted the old 'gui capitalisation' option--I never got around to expanding it beyond a handful of menu labels, it was always too much to work on for too little reward</li>
					<li>improved support for certain broken videos--these will import ok, but full rendering might be borked to different degrees, so let me know how it goes.</li>
					<li>cleared out some old content processing code</li>
					<li>cleared out some old unused db data</li>
					<li>removed all old 'waiting politely' download settings and gui code</li>
					<li>misc prep work for wx update</li>
					<li>misc gui code refactoring</li>
					<li>misc downloader cleanup and timing tweaks</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 266</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>converted gallery downloaders to the new network engine</li>
					<li>greatly simplified how gallery downloaders report network activity and converted them to show the new network job control as well</li>
					<li>subscriptions also work on the new engine but will not show network gui yet</li>
					<li>hacked hentai foundry and pixiv login to use the new network engine</li>
					<li>successful logins to hf or pixiv now print to the log</li>
					<li>the new network engine now clears temporary session cookies after 90 mins of inactivity</li>
					<li>gallery downloaders and subscriptions now use the new 'downloader instance' and subscription bandwidth rules. by default, this means downloaders will do small bursts every five minutes and that subscriptions will do at most 256MB per day</li>
					<li>subscriptions' bandwidth use is now listed by name in the review bandwidth panel</li>
					<li>subscriptions use a new bandwidth test to determine if they should start or continue based on current bandwidth limits. it should mean subs do a good bit of work and then stop when they are supposed to without ever waiting on bandwidth more than 30s or so</li>
					<li>thread watcher and page of images now ignore bandwidth limits when doing their 'page' fetching part</li>
					<li>gallery page fetching will ignore bandwidth rules (in order to stop gallery walk desyncs from having to wait a long time)--it will fetch one page per five seconds</li>
					<li>the thread watcher and page of images importers now work on their files and page-checking simultaneously--also, the page of images will process its page queue at any time, not only when the current file queue is finished</li>
					<li>the gallery downloader page now works on its files and gallery page parsing simultaneously!</li>
					<li>wrote a 'file import status' control to better wrap up the import summary, progress gauge, and file import status button into one panel</li>
					<li>thread watchers now use the new file status control</li>
					<li>'page of images' downloaders now use the new file status control</li>
					<li>the gallery downloaders now use the new file status control</li>
					<li>all network jobs will now retry up to four times on the BadStatusLine ConnectionError, which seems to be a TLS (https) negotiation timeout/remote termination</li>
					<li>all requests on the new network engine will now timeout after ten seconds</li>
					<li>they will also retry on generic timeout errors</li>
					<li>popup messages can now be shown in 'modal' mode as a dialog that prohibits interaction with the rest of the client.</li>
					<li>these will not boot while the client is minimised</li>
					<li>database maintenance routines will now all publish messages like this</li>
					<li>'migrate database' panel now publishes a modal message when it does a file rebalance</li>
					<li>rewrote the controller-side pubsub pipeline to respond faster and consume fewer program resources, particularly for the client</li>
					<li>import pages now update themselves in a less spammy way behind the scenes, meaning more active pages can be open at once without them stepping on each other and clogging things up</li>
					<li>simplified how importers set their status information in several ways</li>
					<li>reduced a swath of pubsub spam related to content updates</li>
					<li>improved how spammy small jobs are written to the profile log</li>
					<li>reduced text flicker on all download pages</li>
					<li>more misc pubsub improvements</li>
					<li>reduced some gui update/refresh spam on hidden pages</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of database->gui message reporting and cleanup code</li>
					<li>added close other/left/right pages to tab right-click menu</li>
					<li>the top-right media hover window will no longer refit-flicker on a ratings change</li>
					<li>wrote a new panel wrapper for listctrls that handles the underlying row of buttons in a neater way and automatically disables them if they are nullipotent (mostly, this means greying out 'delete' buttons when nothing is selected)</li>
					<li>several listctrls use this new panel</li>
					<li>when it is not strictly necessary, videos that are >30MB will no longer use the CPU-expensive manual frame count parsing</li>
					<li>a problem where newly reloaded thread watchers could sometimes stick in a 1/1 initialisation state _should_ be fixed</li>
					<li>fixed gelbooru url parsing (they stopped using the janky redirect.php urls)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue that meant ipfs pin was erroring when trying to show gui-side</li>
					<li>'page of images' downloaders now protest if they are told to close while working</li>
					<li>some small layout and status text fixes</li>
					<li>adminside petition processing now has a 'flip selected' box to flip checked status of all selected contents</li>
					<li>adminside petition processing contents chechklistbox now supports multiple selection</li>
					<li>improved the reliability of some shutdown code</li>
					<li>cleared out some old unused code</li>
					<li>misc new control cleanup</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
					<li>more misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 265</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the bandwidth engine now recognises individual thread watcher threads as a network context that can inherit default bandwidth rules</li>
					<li>tweaked default bandwidth rules and reset existing rules to this new default</li>
					<li>review all bandwidth frame now has a time delta button to choose how the network contexts are filtered</li>
					<li>review all bandwidth frame now updates itself every 20 seconds or so</li>
					<li>review all bandwidth frame now has a 'delete history' button</li>
					<li>review all bandwidth frame now shows if services have specific rules</li>
					<li>review all bandwidth frame now has an 'edit default rules' button that lets you select and set rules for default network contexts</li>
					<li>review network context bandwidth frame now has a bar chart to show historical usage!</li>
					<li>bar chart is optional based on matplotlib availability</li>
					<li>review network context bandwidth frame now lists current bandwidth rules and current usage. it says whether these are default or specific rules</li>
					<li>review network context bandwidth frame now has a button to edit/clear specific rules</li>
					<li>rows of bandwidth rules and current usage, where presented in ui, are now ordered in ascending time delta</li>
					<li>misc bandwidth code improvements</li>
					<li>client file imports are now bundled into their own job object that generates cpu-expensive file metadata outside of the main file and database locks. file imports are now much less laggy and should generally block the feel of the ui much less</li>
					<li>removed the database 'rebalance files' menu entry</li>
					<li>removed the 'client files location' page from options</li>
					<li>db client_files rebalance will no longer occur in idle or shutdown time</li>
					<li>(this stuff is now handled in the migrate database dialog)</li>
					<li>'migrate database' now uses a dialog, meaning you cannot interact with the rest of the program while it is open</li>
					<li>migrate database now has file location editing verbs--add, remove, +/- weight, rebalance_now. thumbnail location and portable db migration will be added next week</li>
					<li>flushed out the backup guide in the getting started help, including to reflect the new internal process</li>
					<li>the client now saves the 'last session' gui session before running a database backup</li>
					<li>the shutdown maintenance yes/no dialog will now auto-no after 15 seconds</li>
					<li>gave status bar tabs a bit more space for their text (some window managers were cutting them off)</li>
					<li>tumblr api lookups are now https</li>
					<li>tumblr files uploaded pre-2013 will no longer receive the 68. subdomain stripping, as they are not supported at the media.tumblr.com domain (much like 'raw' urls)</li>
					<li>pages will now not 'start' their download queues or thread checkers or whatever data checking loops they have until their initial media results are loaded</li>
					<li>key events started from an autocomplete entry but consumed by a higher window (typically F5 or F9/ctrl+t for refresh or new page at the main gui level) will no longer be duplicated</li>
					<li>fixed a shutdown issue with network job controls that could break a clean shutdown in some circumstances</li>
					<li>if the user attempts to create more than 128 pages, the client will now instead complain with a popup message. Due to OS-based gui handle limits, more than this many pages increasingly risks a crash</li>
					<li>if the client has more than 128 pages both open and waiting in the undo menu, it will destroy the 'closed' ones</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 264</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>converted the page of images downloader to the new network engine</li>
					<li>converted the thread watcher downloader to the new network engine</li>
					<li>rejiggered page of images and thread watcher management panels to better separate the two loops they work on</li>
					<li>rejiggered some more downloader layout stuff in prep for a new control to better display url cache and overall import status--downloader-global pause button is now always at the top, for instance</li>
					<li>removed 'waiting politely' indicator from download pages that use the new network engine</li>
					<li>network job controls now have a simple border</li>
					<li>network job controls will show current bytes progress and speed in a more intelligent and useful way--no longer spamming the initial 0KB/s, for instance, and flashing more useful summary information when downloading many small files</li>
					<li>network job controls now display their current bytes progress and speed on a separate right-aligned text beside the main status text (to stop the speed text jumping around so much)</li>
					<li>network job controls will not show the current download speed until some bytes are actually read</li>
					<li>wrote a first version of 'services->review bandwidth' review frame, which lists all network contexts with data in the past month</li>
					<li>wrote an independant and live-updating review frame for indivdual network contexts, launched from the review bandwidth frame, which shows current and historical bandwidth use for that context</li>
					<li>the main gui status bar now reports current bandwidth usage! updated once a second</li>
					<li>database->backup process now has some nicer gui, better and more reliable workflow, improved file copy notification, and now correctly obeys a popup-cancel command</li>
					<li>started the new 'migrate database' gui under the database menu. it currently shows live usage and will gain some verb buttons to atomically alter things hopefully next week</li>
					<li>moved from a strict begin/commit db model to a save/release system that only commits changes to disk at most every ten seconds or so. small 'write' transactions will now often have no disk-sync overhead and so are super fast, particularly when they come in a large batch.</li>
					<li>simplified database connection, disconnection, begin, commit, and rollback code significantly</li>
					<li>the url table in the client database is now non-unique (i.e. multiple files can have the same url). this may lead to undesired 'already in db' or 'deleted' statuses in some downloaders as they check for url status before starting their downloads. if this change turns out to a be a big pain in the future for pixiv manga or whatever, it may be revisited.</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in deviant art parser that sometimes meant nsfw urls could not be found</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where progress gauges could sometimes get stuck in a pulsing state</li>
					<li>fixed a bug with the new optimised result building which sometimes occured when all the files in a batch had common ipfs service membership</li>
					<li>improved support for unusual videos</li>
					<li>improved accuracy of duration calculation for unusual videos</li>
					<li>improved database optimisation after initial and ongoing repository processing</li>
					<li>a 'wake subscriptions' event now occurs even on 'manage subscriptions' cancel (meaning temporarily-dialog-paused subs will always continue after the dialog is closed)</li>
					<li>added a careful manual commit to stop the possibility of the definition-desync some users noticed after a power-loss during a big repository sync commit</li>
					<li>removed some redundant old db compatibility code</li>
					<li>permitted sqlite installations that allow in-memory temporary tables to use them (but not for vacuums, which tend to be a bit big for this stuff)</li>
					<li>cleaned up some redundant timer id code</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 263</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>greatly improved how gui sessions are loaded--now the page tabs are loaded instantly, but the thumbnails are loaded in the background. session loaded should be significantly less laggy and buggy</li>
					<li>the issue of pages sometimes initially sizing at zero size (which could be caused by minimising the client while a session load was ongoing) should hence be better/fixed completely!</li>
					<li>gui sessions will now load their files in the exact order in which they were saved--behaviour that I think was not previously always reliable</li>
					<li>more general network code work and polishing</li>
					<li>added and improved unit tests for network code</li>
					<li>improved how short-time-delta data bandwidth is reported</li>

					<li>tumblr parser now produces https urls</li>
					<li>cleaned up tumblr parser a little</li>
					<li>url caches will clip existing tumblr urls of the 68.-subdomain and convert to the new raw format, clearing out dupes along the way</li>
					<li>url caches will convert existing tumblr and pixiv urls to https, clearing out dupes along the way</li>
					<li>the pixiv parser now deals with missing creator/title tags without errors</li>
					<li>extended the specific file domain tag cache to also store deleted mappings, resulting in much faster request building for clients with large numbers of deleted mappings</li>
					<li>improved some downloader page queue text display timing</li>
					<li>added support for more types of mp4 file</li>
					<li>improved how some memory maintenance calls work</li>
					<li>improved how hydrus datacaches track their recently-used-data fifo list</li>
					<li>pages now regularly clear out spare thumbnail canvas bmps</li>
					<li>pages now regularly clear out cached thumbnail canvas bmps when they are not the currently viewed page</li>
					<li>import caches, when asked for url membership, will now test both the http and https versions the url</li>
					<li>maybe improved how 'open in file browser' works in windows</li>
					<li>fixed the 'recount video frames' advanced thumbnail menu entry, which wasn't working with the new ffmpeg wrapper</li>
					<li>moved some bloaty master hash data out of client.db and into client.master.db</li>
					<li>pubsub profile will no longer profile 'message', as it just makes for spam</li>
					<li>reduced some serverside pubsub spam</li>
					<li>reduced some significant clientside pubsub spam that I think was smashing the gui event loop at inconvenient moments</li>
					<li>improved some client shutdown object sync code</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where some duplicate maintenance popups would not clear themselves up properly if interrupted mid-job</li>
					<li>cleaned up some http-https conversion and comparison code</li>
					<li>fixed some status-setting code that meant thumbnail pages were sometimes setting status after they were replaced and scheduled for deletion</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 262</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added apng support!</li>
					<li>sessions will now append from the default insertion index (e.g. right of current page)</li>
					<li>sessions will now load in the correct order if the default insertion index is to the left of the current page!</li>
					<li>fixed an issue with custom 'favorites' gelbooru parsers</li>
					<li>manage parents/siblings dialogs now load their larger datasets on a thread, after initialising</li>
					<li>sped up how some default thumbnails are generated on client boot</li>
					<li>sped up how resized thumbnails are generated</li>
					<li>refactored ffmpeg video parsing to be simpler and easier to maintain</li>
					<li>improved some ffmpeg parsing to be much faster</li>
					<li>ffmpeg can now parse video that reports no duration</li>

					<li>wrote tests for the bandwidth rules object, including covering the new short time delta support</li>
					<li>improved reliability and speed of bandwidth unit tests</li>
					<li>wrote tests for the new domain-based bandwidth manager</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
					<li>more misc improvements</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 261</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote a new manage dialog for urls</li>
					<li>added 'manage known urls' to media right-click menus!</li>
					<li>double-left-clicking on any video animation will 'open externally'!</li>
					<li>added an option to options->gui to set where new pages will appear by default--either far left/right or left/right of current page</li>
					<li>the tumblr parser now produces '_raw' urls when the post was posted in 2013 or later</li>
					<li>created a new 'number' subtag cache that will be populated on update</li>
					<li>created a new 'tag as number' system predicate that can search for, say, all 'page:' tags > 200</li>
					<li>bandwidth management now tracks requests and num_bytes more sensibly</li>
					<li>bandwidth tracking objects can now better handle bandwidth usage and rule application in short intervals (i.e. sub-5-second) (however, the current networking engine cannot yet use this information accurately)</li>

				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 260</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed video parsing when the video metadata includes random non-utf-friendly garbage</li>
					<li>fixed video parsing when ffmpeg reports no fps at all</li>
					<li>improved video frame counting accuracy</li>
					<li>thumbnail waterfall process now adapts to the current speed of the cache and can hence use significantly less overhead</li>
					<li>the thumbnail fading process now adapts to the current rendering speed, delivering smooth fade when CPU is available but otherwise skipping frames and more reliably filling in thumbnails within a quarter of a second</li>
					<li>canvases now draw their thumbnails with slightly less overhead</li>
					<li>increased database synchronous pragma to FULL to better safeguard against power loss during multiple-db commit--we'll see if it slows things down too much, and maybe add an option about it</li>
					<li>cleaned up and improved some client gui pubsubs</li>
					<li>made pubsub profile mode far less popup-spammy</li>
					<li>if a profile takes less than 20ms, it now won't be fully printed to the log</li>
					<li>tweaked some more server object maintenance code</li>
					<li>added 'changelog' link to help menu</li>
					<li>updated lz4 library and fixed some old deprecated calls</li>

					<li>misc fixes</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
					<li>misc code cleaning</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 259</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>planned out new networking engine and started the principal objects</li>
					<li>renamed the 'exact match' duplicate status to 'same quality', to reduce confusion on what is appropriate for this status</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter, on hitting the delete key, now offers the option of deleting both files</li>
					<li>the duplicate system now combines duplicate status setting and the consequent batch of content updates into the same database transaction, speeding things up</li>
					<li>the duplicate system now batches multiple duplicate status setting into a single transaction, massively speeding up large filters or thumbnail status set actions</li>
					<li>misc duplicate help tweaks</li>
					<li>you can now edit the default duplicate merge options from the new thumbnail duplicate menu</li>
					<li>the duplicates page's jobs are less demanding on gui time and take better breaks if something else happens</li>
					<li>renamed the new dupe system predicate to 'system:num duplicate relationships' to clarify what it searches</li>
					<li>for normal queries, current and pending mappings are now fetched from a faster mappings cache. you should see faster result building across the board, particularly on fresh boots or otherwise slow-disk-access systems</li>
					<li>added a prototype 'advanced mode' (defaulting to off, so experienced users will want to turn it on) under the help menu that will enable menu items that are often not helpful to new users. I will add more things to this in future, suggestions welcome</li>
					<li>the new thumbnail menu dupe relationship set stuff is now considered advanced</li>
					<li>thumbnail menu find similar files is now considered advanced</li>
					<li>the thumbnail menu copy hash entries are now considered advanced</li>
					<li>advanced content update buttons (on manage tags and review services) are now considered advanced</li>
					<li>added an advanced mode 'open file location' entry to the thumbnail share menu, which will open the file in your OS's file explorer (not available on Linux)</li>
					<li>added an advanced mode 'correct video frame count' thumbnail menu entry that will force-apply last week's more accurate video frame counter to correct and videos that render too fast and then cut off</li>
					<li>fixed many entries on the media viewer menus, which were being blocked by an over-eager 'can continue' test and hence silently failing</li>
					<li>fixed the youtube downloader on Linux and OS X--both now use youtube-dl</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where the GetLighterDarkerColour function was producing very bright alternates to very dark colours (meaning dark dupe filters were having their bright background text rendered unreadable)</li>
					<li>improved video frame number parsing accuracy</li>
					<li>improved the accurate version of video frame number parsing accuracy, particularly for longer videos</li>
					<li>the network engine now reports 5xx http status codes as ServerException to better contextualise to the user what went wrong</li>
					<li>adminside mapping petitions are now sub-ordered by tag</li>
					<li>adminside sibling/parent petitions are now ordered by the 'older' tag and sub-ordered by the 'newer' tag</li>

					<li>reduced default shutdown work max time to five minutes</li>
					<li>improved how subprocesses are started</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 258</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added a duplicate entry to the thumbnail right-click menu</li>
					<li>the new duplicate menu will now attempt to fetch known duplicate counts for the focused file for the current file domain (if the db is locked, it will say so rather than block)</li>
					<li>the new duplicate menu's counts in the thumbnail menu can be clicked to show those files in a new page</li>
					<li>the new duplicate menu allows you to set the four main dupe statuses (with default merge options), or a customised verson of the same, or set unknown/potential, or delete dupe status completely, for all the possible pairs in the current selection</li>
					<li>added tentative support for variable framerate files, manually counting up their frames and displaying them with an averaged constant framerate in the client renderer. this now permits a number of webms that were previously 'mime unsupported'. let me know how it works for you!</li>
					<li>cleaned some server locking code, hopefully fixing the ssl handshake issue (which is actually a deadlocking issue)</li>
					<li>export file dialogs will remember the last value of 'export tags to .txt files?', and clicking that checkbox will always launch the dialog for editing (rather than clearing if there are some set)</li>
					<li>fixed the advanced content update (as used by service-wide update), which was not able to differentiate namespaces since the recent service changes. I apologise to anyone affected by this--I will add some unit tests to make sure it doesn't happen again</li>
					<li>reworked and cleaned some canvas event handling code</li>
					<li>the canvas will now accept mouse wheel events even when it does not have focus</li>
					<li>the canvas frame will no longer accept keyboard events (and hence activate fullscreen_switch) if the mouse is over a flash window</li>
					<li>hydrus servers now respond to /robots.txt with a 'disallow all'</li>
					<li>servers will now provide mappings petitions to admins in groups of similar size, rather than mixing petitions of weight 5000 with a hundred of weight 1</li>
					<li>fixed the back/skip buttons in the archive/delete filter's top hover window</li>
					<li>the file path tagging dialog's namespace and regular regexes now support parenthesis groups, and in that case will take each of those submatches instead of the wider match</li>
					<li>hence regexes with groups will now compile in that dialog</li>
					<li>you can now 'new page here' on the final (rightmost) page tab</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where media-viewer-launched manage tags frames would yield focus to the main gui if they had opened a sub-dialog while they were open</li>
					<li>the tag censorship edit panel now has a 'help here -->' label in blue text</li>
					<li>file imports will fail properly when the final temp_path->client_files file copy operation fails (due, for instance, to the destination being on a removable medium that was recently disconnected)</li>
					<li>fixed serverside upnp maintenance, which was silently failing early, and also updated it to the new server object code</li>
					<li>wrote a new checklistbox dialog that handles the underlying data explicitly rather than messing around with external text->data maps</li>
					<li>replaced all the old string checklistbox dialog instances with the new one</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now correctly clear their 'recent error' status on a successful sync</li>
					<li>refactored and cleaned how basic mediaresult objects store and consult simple file information</li>
					<li>locationsmanager objects now handle inbox status and the related content update events that affect it</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in HydrusTagArchive when attempting to figure out hash type from an existing hash</li>
					<li>removed the obsolete servertoclientcontentupdatepackage object</li>
					<li>misc duplicate code cleanup</li>
					<li>misc serverside service code improvements</li>
					<li>misc small fixes</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 257</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the duplicate filter will now maintain zoom on files with the same ratio</li>
					<li>split the duplicate merge options into separate tag/rating controls--you may see some duplicate service entries, but these will be cleaned on your next shutdown</li>
					<li>duplicate merge options now allow syncing 'archive' status</li>
					<li>duplicate merge options now allow 'delete both files', which you may find use for in custom actions</li>
					<li>created a tag censorship object to handle and action a rich tag censorship ruleset</li>
					<li>tag duplicate merge options now have and use this tag censorship object to filter which tags are merged, with an initial value of 'let everything through'</li>
					<li>wrote a tag censorship edit panel and tied it into the duplicate action edit panel so these new tag censorship objects can be edited</li>
					<li>added an optimisation to the duplicate status setting code--if two files are better/worse, they are inherantly duplicates and so 'not dupe' and 'alternate' relationships apply to both equally and can be duplicated</li>
					<li>fixed and culled and normalised the 'this has more tags' dupe filter statements to be more accurate and useful</li>
					<li>added 'this has a larger filesize' type-statements to the dupe filter</li>
					<li>created a 'system:duplicate relationships' predicate that can find files based on how many duplicate relationships of a particular type they have</li>
					<li>cleaned up some misc duplicate filter code and added some tooltips to the top hover window dupe action buttons</li>
					<li>added 'move to left/right end' to main gui page tab right-click menu</li>
					<li>added 'new page' and 'new page here' to main gui page tab right-click menu</li>
					<li>you can now right-click for a menu from empty tab space on the main gui</li>
					<li>the main gui statusbar now updates more efficiently when under heavy refresh load</li>
					<li>the main gui statusbar now shows db read/write/commit status and sets the current db job summary as its tooltip--if you experience persistent hangs, please hover over the statusbar and report what you see!</li>
					<li>export tags to .txts checkbox will now default to 'all services on' when checked</li>
					<li>fixed the thread watcher, which was accidentally disabling its text input early</li>
					<li>'similar files' searches launched from the thumbnail menu will now default to 'my files' file domain rather than 'all local files'</li>
					<li>downloader pages will now correctly sort their files on initialisation</li>
					<li>refactored and generally cleaned up some collect and sort code</li>
					<li>fixed some unlikely-but-possible collect/sort bugs</li>
					<li>fixed some bad layout in the top-right hover window that was making it grow unreasonably tall when many urls were shown</li>
					<li>on the different download import pages, the progress gauge that shows file download progress will now reset back to 0 as soon as the file download is complete</li>
					<li>fixed a problem where video imports with unicode characters in their path were failing to mime-parse</li>
					<li>improved the file import status update pipeline to better deal with large transactions (like skipping/deleting/retrying a thousand rows at once). all these big transactions should lag the gui far less</li>
					<li>improved some misc import status cache code</li>
					<li>made first step in a big size rewrite job that will size many elements according to local system font size rather than specific pixel values</li>
					<li>hydrus servers now explicitly default to TLSv1.2--we'll see if that clears up some of the handshake timeout problems we have recently seen</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of possible pydeadobjecterrors when the new review services panel is closed</li>
					<li>improved and rescheduled gelbooru redirect url purge</li>
					<li>added a catch-and-recovery to hydrus network session initialisation, which may sometimes receive invalid data after a service deletion</li>
					<li>added similar catches to tag parent/sibling initialisation, which apparently can be vulnerable to a similar invalid data problem</li>
					<li>I think I cleaned up some more Linux ClientToScreen console errors</li>
					<li>refactored and cleaned some frame size event responsibility</li>
					<li>refactored and cleaned the panel and controls that display file import status</li>
					<li>did a little more menu code cleanup</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 256</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the duplicate filter now loads new pairs off the gui thread. it will display 'loading pairs...' during this time</li>
					<li>media viewers of all kinds are now more comfortable displaying no media (when this occurs, it is usually a frame or two during startup/shutdown)</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now responds to any media_viewer_browser navigation commands (like view_next) with a media switch action</li>
					<li>you can now alter the duplicate filter's background lighten/darken switch intensity from its top hover window's cog icon</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in the new dupe pair selection algorithm that was preventing pairs from being presented as groups</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter will now speed up workflow by automatically skipping pairs when you have previously chosen to delete one of the files in the current batch</li>
					<li>auto-skipped pairs _should_ be auto-reverse-skipped on a 'go back' action</li>
					<li>added a |< 'go back' index navigation button to the duplicate filter top hover window</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now displays several 'this file has larger resolution'-type statements about the currently viewed file. it lists them on the top hover window and in the background details text underneath</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter _roughly_ attempts to put the better file of the two first. this will always be indexed 'A'</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now shows done/total batch progress in its index string--not sure how clear/helpful this ultimately is, so may need to revisit</li>
					<li>an unusual bug where Linux would spam the 'All pairs have been filtered!' duplicate filter message over and over and then crash _should_ be fixed--the filter no longer waits for that message to be OKed before closing itself</li>
					<li>drag-and-dropping text onto the client will now a) open a url import page if none already exist and b) put the dropped text into the input box of the first open url import page (and focus it, so you can quickly hit enter)! This works when dragging text links from browsers, as well</li>
					<li>you can now 'append' gui sessions, which will just append that session's tabs to whatever is already open--say, if you have several 'favourites' pages you want to be able to quickly load up without having to break your existing workflow</li>
					<li>ipfs services now have a 'check daemon' button on their review services panel which will test the daemon is running and accessible and report its version</li>
					<li>fixed the 'test address' button for ipfs services on their manage services panel</li>
					<li>the client can now automatically download files it wants and knows are on an ipfs service</li>
					<li>middle-click on an 'all known files' domain thumbnail will now correctly start a download (as long as a specific remote file service is known)</li>
					<li>the multihash prefix option is reinstated on ipfs manage services panels</li>
					<li>the gelbooru parser now discovers the correct page url to associate with its files</li>
					<li>wrote some redirect fetching code to fix the gelbooru bad urls issue</li>
					<li>discovered a quicker fix for the gelbooru issue--the redirect location is the garbage in the original url in base64</li>
					<li>all downloader/subscription url caches will purge any old gelbooru 'redirect.php' urls on update</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where 'previously deleted' gallery/thread imports were returning 'fail'</li>
					<li>fixed a problem that was causing some redundant laggy work in adminside petition processing</li>
					<li>thread watchers will now remember their file and tag import options through a session save even when no thread url has yet been entered</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where media 'removed' from a media viewer view of a collection resulted in the entire collection being removed at the thumbnail level</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where media deleted from a media viewer view of a collection resulted in the media not being correctly removed from selection tags</li>
					<li>tag, namespace, and wildcard searches on a specific file domain (i.e. other than 'all known files') now take advantage of an optimisation in the autocomplete cache and so run significantly faster</li>
					<li>fixed a hover window coordinate calculation issue after minimising the media viewer on some platforms</li>
					<li>removed some 'all files failed to download' spam that could sometimes occur</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 255</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the duplicate filter now supports shift+left-click to drag, like the archive/delete filter (this remains hardcoded for now)</li>
					<li>if a pair in the dupe filter has the same resolution, they will now maintain zoom and pan when switching back and forth (I might increase this to work for same ratio as well, let me know how it works in the real world)</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter will show a lighter/darker background colour as you scroll the current pair</li>
					<li>the way lighter/darker and alternate lighter/darker colours are calculated is now centralised and should be more reliable in edge cases</li>
					<li>improved the dupe filter pair selection algorithm--it now chooses pairs more reliably under edge case conditions and prioritises decision-groups that have high potential decision value. it should also run a little faster</li>
					<li>increased the dupe filter batch size to 250, let's see if it causes any problems</li>
					<li>the close button on the dupe filter's top hover window now works</li>
					<li>fixed the duplicate filter disappearing pairs that were skipped (meaning you could not go back to revisit them)</li>
					<li>fixed a frequent deadobject error when the dupe filter closes</li>
					<li>the shutdown 'maintenance due' test is less sensitive to dupe search tree rebalancing, which typically only takes half a second</li>
					<li>the archive/delete filter now uses the new shortcuts system for both keyboard and mouse input</li>
					<li>the archive/delete filter now intercepts archive or delete commands from different sources ('media' shortcuts, top hover frame button presses) more reliably and converts them into filter actions (hence moving on to the next file)</li>
					<li>you can now move pages one to the left or right from their menu!</li>
					<li>on the top-right hover window (and the background underneath), ratings are now on the top, and hence will always be in the same location as you scroll through your media regardless of known urls, remote location, or inbox status</li>
					<li>autocomplete searches for tags with apostrophes, quote marks, braces, brackets and paretheses should be more reliable</li>
					<li>urls are now associated with files through the same 'content' pipeline as tags and ratings and so on</li>
					<li>gui-level media is now aware of the 'new url content update' event and will update and redraw itself appropriately</li>
					<li>fixed deviant art nsfw parsing, but it might not hold for long. proper fix here is to wait for the downloader overhaul</li>
					<li>networking engine now uses the 'requests' module's CA .pem (which the overhaul will be moving to anyway), which should reduce the frequency of ssl verify failures (gelbooru on the relatively new 'Let's Encrypt' CA had this problem for many users)</li>
					<li>fixed the networking engine redirect parsing for gelbooru's unusual location header. unfortunately, gelbooru is still giving mickey-mouse garbage redirect urls from its main thumbnail pages, for which in this engine there is no immediate fix</li>
					<li>neighbouring .txt tags will now be properly cleaned and sibling-collapsed in the path tagging dialog</li>
					<li>neighbouring .txt tags will now be properly sibling-collapsed in the import folder workflow</li>
					<li>making a media viewer borderless fullscreen and back will now recenter the media (previously, the current drag delta was not reset, so this frequently put media off-screen)</li>
					<li>fixed a serious issue where the media viewer could lock the client up on opening with a video if its gui options set 'remember size' to false</li>
					<li>tag import options objects will cleanse themselves of missing services on options save/client shutdown</li>
					<li>manage tags now defaults to cross-referencing 'my files' on the 'local tags' domain, where 'remote' (i.e. deleted) files' tags are not useful</li>
					<li>reduced memory use when importing large pngs with transparency</li>
					<li>improved adminside petition processing gui reporting</li>
					<li>servers will now cap the size of their mapping petitions so as not to ovewhelm the admin processing them (they now won't be both >20 tags and >1000 total row weight)</li>
					<li>the media viewer's manage tags frame now listens for content updates from outside, so if you alter an in-view file's tags (such as with a shortcut key), the manage tags dialog will update as it happens</li>
					<li>moved a number of the buttons on the top hover windows to the new unified internal command engine (which the new shortcut system also uses)</li>
					<li>disk cache maintenance uses fewer resources but now occurs in the foreground (and should hence more reliably maintain the cache)</li>
					<li>critical repository service id lookup errors will now automatically reset the repository's processing cache and better inform the user of what has happened. if you see this, please let me know the details and how this error fired in the real world</li>
					<li>updated and reinstated the ipfs service panel in review services</li>
					<li>updated some ipfs service code for the new service system</li>
					<li>misc refactoring and cleanup</li>
					<li>more cleanup and deletion of redundant old pubsub command code</li>
					<li>updated ubuntu build machine to 17.04 and opencv 3.2</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 254</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the duplicate processing page is now on the new page picker, under the new menu 'special'</li>
					<li>improved the dupe pair selection algorithm--it should be faster for everyone</li>
					<li>added help icon to dupe processing page--it can launch of a couple of message boxes with simple help, or you can open some html help</li>
					<li>wrote some dupe processing html help!</li>
					<li>the dupe processing page now refreshes its numbers when the dupe filter closes</li>
					<li>the archive, inbox, delete, and undelete buttons on the duplicate filter's top hover frame now work</li>
					<li>delete and shift+delete keys now work to delete/undelete a file in the duplicate filter</li>
					<li>the mouse cursor now hides/shows on halt and new movement on the duplicate filter</li>
					<li>you can now set 'content' shortcut actions (adding tags or ratings) to shortcuts in the 'media' reserved shortcut set (which are always on in media contexts), although they don't yet work in the thumbnail view yet</li>
					<li>added a help button to the manage shortcuts panel</li>
					<li>the edit shortcuts dialog will now now allow you to name a custom shortcut set to one of the reserved names and will explain the problem in a message box</li>
					<li>import pages update more efficiently during periods of busy cpu</li>
					<li>import pages will use less idle cpu time generally</li>
					<li>import pages will adaptively use less cpu time when they are in the undo deletion queue or have no files to import</li>
					<li>the page of images downloader will spam a little less idle time</li>
					<li>the canvas background details and the top-right hover window will now only show 10 urls max</li>
					<li>added a help button to the tag import options panel to better explain the namespace selection and explicit tags</li>
					<li>added 'gui report mode' to the help menu, which will report key and mouse shortcut events and and matched commands</li>
					<li>the adminside petition panel now sorts multiple petitions by number of files descending</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
					<li>misc help cleanup</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 253</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>created a new object to hold tag and rating merging and 'worse file' deletion options</li>
					<li>wrote a dialog to edit this new object</li>
					<li>established some simple defaults for this object for different duplicate status actions</li>
					<li>the cog icon on the duplicates filter now lets you edit these defaults</li>
					<li>the 'custom' duplicate filter action now works--first by asking you what status you want to set, and then by throwing up the new merge options dialog to tune it to whatever you like</li>
					<li>wrote comprehensive unit tests for the new object</li>
					<li>fixed the super slow dupe filter launch time problem</li>
					<li>added a 'known urls' submenu to thumbnail and browser canvas right-click menu that lists all known urls for a file with an option to launch or copy the url</li>
					<li>added known urls' hosts to the top-right canvas details background, just below where known file repos are listed</li>
					<li>added the same known urls' hosts as clickable hyperlinks to the ratings hover window that pops over that top-right area</li>
					<li>added 'delete from deleted files' action to the local tags's service-wide update panel. it will limit the deletion to mappings that are currently on files that have been previously completely physically deleted from the program</li>
					<li>fixed namespace filtering on service-wide update panel</li>
					<li>the hentai foundry downloader broke, so the update code will pause all hf subs. the solution is not trivial (it is part of the downloader overhaul), but I will try to fix it soon</li>
					<li>debuted a new question-mark help button to better explain .txt tag importing on the manual import tagging dialog and the manage import folders dialog</li>
					<li>fixed a small potential error due to bad parsing in the 'page of images' downloader</li>
					<li>fixed a typo bug that stopped the 'delete shortcuts set' action working in the manage shortcuts dialog</li>
					<li>I may have fixed an issue where the server was sometimes not shutting cleanly with a keyboardinterrupt</li>
					<li>fixed the media embed button not reliably updating its thumbnail</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where a dummy animation bar was displaying on embed buttons that showed static images that included transparency</li>
					<li>the serious db missing tag and hash states will now not throw an error but will inform/spam the user (and hence not prohibit a boot)</li>
					<li>attempting to open a second manage tags frame from the media viewer will now instead put the focus on the first (previously, multiple manage tags frames could be made)</li>
					<li>misc db code cleanup that should result in faster result building in certain situations</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
					<li>misc layout fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 252</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the duplicate filter now processes pairs in batches and hence supports 'back' actions to revisit decisions. you will be prompted every fifty or so pairs to commit and checkpoint your progress</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now presents related pairs together, rather than picking at random</li>
					<li>fixed a bug in duplicate filter shortcuts initialisation</li>
					<li>simplified duplicate filter default shortcuts (these will be overwritten on update) to only use simple left- and right-click for 'this is better' and 'alternates', since those are by far the most common actions. middle-click now goes back, like the archive/delete filter</li>
					<li>converted old 'main shortcuts' system to the new shortcuts system, also splitting it up into 'media', 'main_gui', 'media_viewer', and 'media_viewer_browser' constituent parts that will be applied in different contexts</li>
					<li>because the change is so significant, all clients will have their old 'options' shortcuts reset to the new default--I expect to expand shortcuts further in the next few weeks, so this default-overwriting will likely happen again, so you will likely wish to wait before recustomising your basic shortcuts</li>
					<li>completely eliminated the old main shortcuts system--all references now bodge with the new system to varying neatness</li>
					<li>as the old main shortcuts system no longer exists, the 'shortcuts' page on file->options is gone--all shortcuts are now managed through file->shortcuts, which is a completely revamped version of the custom filter shortcuts editing dialog</li>
					<li>selecting shortcut commands is significantly simpler for the reserved shortcut sets</li>
					<li>all media viewers with hover windows now have a 'keyboard' shortcuts icon button on their top hover window--it links to the manage shortcuts dialog as well as the current active custom shortcut sets and default custom shortcut sets</li>
					<li>as the above system supercedes the old custom filter system, custom filters are completely removed from the program! your existing custom shortcut sets will survive, but you probably want to purge them of all the redundant junk they still have</li>
					<li>all the media canvases use the new shortcuts system</li>
					<li>the canvas frame uses the new shortcuts system</li>
					<li>the thumbnails canvas uses the new shortcuts system</li>
					<li>the main gui uses the new shortcuts system</li>
					<li>some other misc places use the new shortcuts system</li>
					<li>most simple shortcut command actions have been renamed to be more readable</li>
					<li>some shortcut actions, like zoom stuff, is no longer hardcoded!</li>
					<li>mouse shortcuts are still not widely supported!</li>
					<li>the shortcut command edit dialog now throws a veto-driven error message if you try to ok on an invalid command (a blank services choice or action string, that sort of thing)</li>
					<li>ctrl+r is now 'remove_files_from_view' by default. the old 'show_hide_splitters' is now ctrl+shift+r by default</li>
					<li>the preview canvas, if focused, now responds to many normal media viewer shortcuts (content stuff like archive/manage tags, and canvas-specific like frame back/forth, zooming and panning)</li>
					<li>the new shortcut system now interprets double-clicks of any mouse button to be a second single click</li>
					<li>the new shortcut system correctly 'flips' ratings on and off, rather than always 'setting' to the chosen value. optional 'set only' support will come in the near future</li>
					<li>more shortcuts will correctly and reliably propagate to canvases when any part of a hover frame has focus</li>
					<li>fixed a conflict between the new shortcut system and taglists, which were no longer accepting otherwise interesting keys, like enter</li>
					<li>created a shortcuts manager cache that deals with a bunch of the shortcut workflow centrally</li>
					<li>completely eliminated the old accelerator table/menu command system for the main gui window</li>
					<li>lots of misc shortcut-related work</li>
					<li>fixed wildcard file search predicates that are on a specific file service and have no namespace (like 'mar*')</li>
					<li>certain routines that can cause mass refreshing of the menubar (like import folders) will now not spam (and often queue this spam up and hang the gui) the menu so much. the menubar will now always collapse multple overlapping refresh calls to reduce cpu load</li>
					<li>fixed a focus-None issue in the new hover window focus detection code</li>
					<li>improved some more focus detection and comparison logic--quick rating-scrolling in the media viewer should be less janked</li>
					<li>improved 'touch' drag event detection and improved media canvas cursor hide/show logic in general</li>
					<li>fixed '&' display in notebook page names</li>
					<li>fixed '&' display in some common dialogs' text</li>
					<li>wrote a new statictext class that deals with '&' better and in future will autowrap and maybe some other stuff and then switched most of the simple instances of wx.statictext over</li>
					<li>updated some out-of-date server help r.e. admin service initialisation</li>
					<li>converted a little of the help on custom filter->custom shortcuts. I'll do more in future</li>
					<li>wrote a simple checkboxlist dialog</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 251</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>started shortcut overhaul by updating shortcut storage and underlying objects</li>
					<li>shortcuts will now support multiple modifiers (ctrl, alt, shift) in some places</li>
					<li>the regular shortcut entry control now supports mouse events through a radiobox (although only the duplicate filter will capture and deal with mouse events on the new system!)</li>
					<li>on db creation or update, a new 'duplicate_filter' shortcut set will be generated that includes mouse shortcuts and new duplicate_filter commands</li>
					<li>the duplicate filter now obeys this shortcut set</li>
					<li>duplicate filter shortcut edit cog menu now works, and the active shortcut set will update if edited</li>
					<li>wrote simple duplicate pair status update db code</li>
					<li>added dupe filtering optimisation--given A > B, anything else better than A will be set to be better than B, and anything worse than B will be set to be worse than A</li>
					<li>added dupe filtering optimisation--after any duplicate status change affecting A and B, any 'same file' siblings of A and B will receive the same relationship</li>
					<li>the 'process now' button on review services is now gated by a yes/no dialog that better explains what's about to happen</li>
					<li>the repository buttons on review services will disable when they can't do anything</li>
					<li>repository update processing will now cancel mid-job much faster</li>
					<li>reintroduced the 'service-wide update' button to tag services in review services</li>
					<li>reintroduced the 'clear trash' button to the trash file service in review services</li>
					<li>reintroduced num_files rating service reporting in review services</li>
					<li>fixed mouse scroll wheel events from the ratings hover window not being correctly processed by the main media canvas</li>
					<li>added some 'touch' event detection to try to better deal with media dragging through a touchscreen</li>
					<li>import folders will now 'action' their import paths as they go, rather than only at the end of their import run</li>
					<li>the new taglists are now better at remembering their selection through a content change</li>
					<li>opening a file or path from a non-windows client should now create a non-child process for open/xdg-open calls that block (so closing the client should not then close the child process movie player application or whatever)</li>
					<li>added unit tests for the new shortcut object</li>
					<li>added unit tests for the new application command object</li>
					<li>fixed unit tests for the updated shortcuts object</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 250</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>improved 'file storage locations' help page descriptive text, including adding statements for actual current storage percentages</li>
					<li>improved boot missing file storage error handling</li>
					<li>wrote a 'repair file storage' dialog panel to manually fix missing folders during the boot phase</li>
					<li>added some bells and whistles to the repair file storage dialog. it now shouldn't be possible to boot the client with an invalid file store--let me know how this works for you</li>
					<li>added 'apply all siblings to all services' to options->tags</li>
					<li>whenever combined-service siblings are consulted, local siblings will now always have precedence (so, you can now definitely overwrite any ptr siblings you don't like at the local level). this stuff remains a mess, however. more work is needed</li>
					<li>fixed searching for 'like' ratings</li>
					<li>rating predicates will now render their value as 'like'/'dislike' or '3/5' rather than the underlying float</li>
					<li>fixed a variety of predicate string rendering errors when 'show namespace' is false</li>
					<li>fixed delete key not firing on autocomplete text entry controls</li>
					<li>the autocomplete entry's text box will now take home/end/up/down events when there is only one result in the dropdown, when navigation of that list is not important (previously, this was only true when there were no results)</li>
					<li>fixed an issue where invalid typed 'system:' tags were not being correctly cleaned</li>
					<li>improved tag cleaning code</li>
					<li>fixed fetching autocomplete results for small and specific searches (e.g. putting in 'a' will return results just for 'a'</li>

					<li>cleaned up some focus checking code</li>
					<li>harmonised all initial key event processing</li>
					<li>cleaned some key event processing</li>
					<li>adjusted some server daemon timings to prefer post-boot update generation catchup over db maintenance</li>
					<li>corrected a bunch of slightly mistaken unit test code</li>
					<li>added some 'like' and 'numerical' ratings search unit tests</li>
					<li>the advanced content update dialog now uses the new sizing system (so the go! button should no longer wander out of frame!)</li>
					<li>reduced what I believe is excess fuzzy padding on the new sizing system</li>
					<li>optimised a common client db request, speeding up a number of tag operations</li>
					<li>gui now asks for confirmation when you make to delete a gui session</li>
					<li>improved some out of date unit tests</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 249</h3></li>

					<li>duplicates filter now reports A or B as file index</li>
					<li>added some placeholder buttons to the duplicates filter for actions and 'cog' customisation</li>
					<li>reduced duplicate search shutdown logspam</li>
					<li>improved duplicate search job cleanup</li>
					<li>improved mime detection of thumbnail regeneration</li>
					<li>improved some shutdown error handling</li>
					<li>improved numerical rating search accuracy</li>
					<li>improved some hdd import error handling</li>
					<li>improved some unicode error handling</li>
					<li>improved reliability of some database transaction processing</li>
					<li>fixed animationbar having problems with single-frame videos</li>
					<li>fixed namespace colour taglist not updating colour correctly</li>
					<li>stopped the namespace colour taglist from deleting default namespace colours</li>
					<li>made the new class of button more compact--not sure if I like it</li>
					<li>refactored some db initialisation to avoid future transaction problems during special updates</li>

				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 248</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed two more issues with recent update code!</li>
					<li>re-applied a more rigorously tested 'invalid subtag' replacement for any user that has experienced incomplete update code in the past few weeks</li>
					<li>added some tag rendering options to options->tags that affect most user-facing, non-editing windows:</li>
					<li>added custom namespace-subtag connector (i.e. instead of ':')</li>
					<li>added 'show namespaces' checkbox (i.e. to keep the colour but lose the namespace, like how most boorus display tags)</li>
					<li>created a basic framework for the duplicate filter--it doesn't do anything yet, but you can launch it from the duplicates page to check it out</li>
					<li>updated 'reset processing cache' action and added it to review services repository pages</li>
					<li>review services now always starts on 'my files'</li>
					<li>review services will try to stay looking at the currently selected service through a refresh_services event</li>
					<li>fixed some thread-gui refresh interaction in review services</li>
					<li>all listctrl-attached delete/remove buttons will now ask if you are sure before they go</li>
					<li>reenabled db->maintenance->clear orphans, which it turns out I had already fixed by accident</li>
					<li>serverside services will lock themselves more efficiently while generating updates, ensuring 'server busy' responses can always return promptly</li>
					<li>fixed tag manage parents a/c entry to remove tags when they already exist in the box (previously, the a/c would only ever add, so a double-click was required to remove)</li>
					<li>tuned adminside petition processing so it approves/denies in reasonable-sized chunks</li>
					<li>refactored all the taglist gui code to focus on the underlying tag rather than the string representation</li>
					<li>plenty of misc taglist cleanup besides</li>
					<li>started a unit test suite for listboxes and wrote a thorough test for namespace colour listbox</li>
					<li>misc canvas refactoring</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 247</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed a problem with deleting more than 256 files at once</li>
					<li>furthermore, deleting from thumbnail view or after a filter will split delete jobs into chunks of 64 files at a time to reduce gui hang from deleting many tag-heavy files</li>
					<li>rewrote canvas media container code to recycle containers, embed windows, animation bars, static image windows, and animation windows. scrolling through all kinds of media is less flickery (less 'grey box' window initialise flicker) and scrolling through static images should be completely flickerless! William Gibson slideshow speed works again!</li>
					<li>this flickerless static image transition will be particularly useful in the forthcoming duplicate image filter!</li>
					<li>got adminside petition processing working again</li>
					<li>petition counts and fetching is now split by content_type and status</li>
					<li>the approve/deny colour hint is more obvious on the petition panel</li>
					<li>petitions now process off the main gui thread and throw up a popup message</li>
					<li>added 'check all' and 'check none' buttons to petition panel</li>
					<li>several serverside petition processing fixes</li>
					<li>generalised and improved dynamic menu check item initialisation and inversion support</li>
					<li>moved the 'get tags even if file already in db' option into a cog button on regular downloader pages</li>
					<li>added a default menu option for 'get tags even if file already in db' to the same cog button</li>
					<li>added this cog button to the edit subscription panel as well</li>
					<li>fixed exporting tags to Hydrus Tag Archives</li>
					<li>fixed exporting 'all known tags' to HTAs</li>
					<li>cleaned some HTA and related code</li>
					<li>fixed namespace based tag censorship</li>
					<li>fixed autocomplete not filtering out current/pending counts if they are set to 'excluded'</li>
					<li>fixed generation of non-expiring new accounts</li>
					<li>fixed some v245->v246 tag improvement code that was replacing invalid tags with the incorrect namespace</li>
					<li>patched a problem with '-:' dirty tag in the v245->v246 update code--I'm not sure what it was doing, but it catches the unusual problem and puts it in the 'invalid tags' category, so let me know if you get trouble with this in future</li>
					<li>wrote unit tests for bytesdictionary and shortcuts serialisable objects</li>
					<li>harmonised and improved how separators are appended to menus</li>
					<li>cleaned up some client db index creation</li>
					<li>cleaned up some client tuple stripping</li>
					<li>misc pylint warnings cleanup</li>
					<li>misc fixes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 246</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed a critical bug in serverside content deserialisating that meant servers were not processing most client-submitted data properly</li>
					<li>fixed a critical bug in 'all known tags' autocomplete regeneration--please run database->regen->a/c cache when it is convenient and let me know if your numbers are still off</li>
					<li>fixed the pre-v238 update problem for good by abandoning update attempts and advising users to try v238 first</li>
					<li>clientside invalid tags will now be collapsed like with the server last week. if a tag is invalid (typically something with an extra space, like "series: blah"), the update code will attempt to replace existing mappings with the collapsed valid version. some unusual cases may remain--they will be replaced with 'invalid namespace "series "' and similar. Please remove and replace these when convenient and contact me if there are way too many for you to deal with</li>
					<li>duplicates pages now have a file domain for the filtering section, and they remember this domain through session loads</li>
					<li>this file domain is accurate--counting potential duplicates and fetching pairs for 'show some pairs' only from those domains. the issue of remote files appearing should be gone!</li>
					<li>there is now only one 'idle' entry in the duplicates page cog menu--it combines the three previous into one</li>
					<li>fixed numerous irregularities across the wildcard code. all search input now has an implicit '*' on the end unless you put a '*' anywhere else, in which case it acts exactly as you enter it, with a non-* beginning matching beginning of string, whitespace, or colon, and non-* end matching end of string or whitespace</li>
					<li>autocomplete now searches namespace, so entering 'char' will load up all the 'character:' tags along with 'series:di gi charat'. this can lag to hell and back, so it may either need some work or be optional in the future. feedback would be appreciated</li>
					<li>typing 'namespace:' will include all the series tags below the special optimised 'namespace:*anything*' tag</li>
					<li>autocomplete searches recognise an explicit '*' no matter where it is in the entry text. typing 'a*' will load up all the a tags and present a 'a*' wildcard option</li>
					<li>quickly entering a wildcard entry will now submit the correct wildcard predicate ('rather than a literal 'hel*' or whatever tag)</li>
					<li>review services panel now reports total mappings info on tag services</li>
					<li>review services panel now reports total files info on file services</li>
					<li>manage services's listctrl is now type | name | deletable and initially sorts by type. the strings used for hydrus service types are also improved</li>
					<li>manage serverside services (called by server admins to manage their services) have fixed setnondupe port and name on edit service events</li>
					<li>new popup messages will now also appear if there were previously no popup messages to display if the current focus is on a child on_top frame, such as review services (you'll now see the processing popup appear when you click 'process now' on review services)</li>
					<li>the popup message manager now initialises its display window with a single message that is quickly dismissed. this helps set up some variables in a safe environment so they don't have to be generated later when the gui might be minimised or otherwise unusual</li>
					<li>hid hydrus update files from 'all local files' searches</li>
					<li>added 'media_view' entries for hydrus update files, just in case they are still visible in some unusual contexts (and they may be again in a future update anyway)</li>
					<li>fixed 'recent tags' being returned from the database out of order</li>
					<li>by default, 'recent tags' is now on for new users</li>
					<li>'get tags even if file already in db' now defaults to False</li>
					<li>file import status now allows a 'delete' action below the 'skip' action</li>
					<li>file import status right-click event processing is more sane</li>
					<li>fixed the new raw width/height sort choices, which were accidentally swapped</li>
					<li>cleaned the media sort code generally</li>
					<li>cleared out some redundant rows that are in some users' client_files_locations</li>
					<li>namespaced predicates are no longer count-merged with their namespaceless versions in 'write' autocomplete dropdowns</li>
					<li>'unknown' accounts should now properly resync after clientside service change</li>
					<li>improved how registration keys are checked serverside when fetching access keys</li>
					<li>fixed a v244 update problem when unexected additional tag parent/sibling petitions rows exist</li>
					<li>improved my free space test code and applied it to the old v243->v244 free space test (it'll now test free space on your temporary path and report problems appropriately)</li>
					<li>to improve log privacy and cleanliness, and to make it easier to report profiles, db/pubsub profiles now write to a separate log file named appropriately and labelled with the process's start time</li>
					<li>profiles are more concise and formatted a little neater</li>
					<li>across the program, three-period ... ellipses are now replaced with their single character unicode  counterpart (except to the console, where any instance of the unicode ellipsis will now be converted back to ...)</li>
					<li>cleaned up some log printing code</li>
					<li>cleaned up some experimental static serialisation code, still thinking if I like it or not</li>
					<li>started on some proper unit tests for hydrus serialisable objects</li>
					<li>fixed and otherwise updated a heap of unit test code to account for the v245 changes</li>
					<li>cleaned up a bunch of old database table join code</li>
					<li>started some databse-query-tuple-stripping code cleaning</li>
					<li>deleted more old unused code</li>
					<li>misc timing improvements</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup experimentation</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 245</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed a v244 update problem for clients updating from <v238</li>
					<li>some misc stuff:</li>
					<li>if you start editing many subscriptions, cancelling a single dialog will break the chain of loading new dialogs</li>
					<li>reduced some redundancy in regular client file import</li>
					<li>improved how the dialog for selection from a list of strings works</li>
					<li>if the client ever merges one directory to another (such as in external file locations migration) and any files fail to merge, the source will no longer be deleted</li>
					<li>created new flexible bandwidth tracking and ruling objects</li>
					<li>updated how repository updates work, splitting the old explicit and self-contained content update package system to a new implicit definitions/content split system and an improved one-step-sync metadata propagation</li>
					<li>updating now takes approximately 23% as much bandwidth as before</li>
					<li>update files are now stored in client_files and server_files like any other file (client_updates and server_updates folders will be deleted on update)</li>
					<li>the server will print update generation info to its log</li>
					<li>unfortunately, updates cannot be converted, so a complete resync of update files is required. the smaller update size and better bandwidth controls should mitigate the problem somewhat</li>
					<li>the server has been compacted across all content types--its mappings db file should shrink about 12%</li>
					<li>due to new service-specific ids, server.master.db should increase in size, typically about 50%</li>
					<li>harmonised how GET and POST/response args are built and parsed across the network</li>
					<li>server administration initialisation is now simpler, done with 'init' registration key</li>
					<li>leading and trailing spaces are now removed from both the namespace and subtag components of namespaced tags, meaning 'title: blah' will be collapsed to 'title:blah'. tag repositories will clean their existing tags on update</li>
					<li>invalid serverside tags will be replaced with valid placeholders on server update</li>
					<li>refactored, harmonised and simplified some server request code</li>
					<li>Eris makes a triumphant return to the root welcome page ('/' request of any service) with improved self-description text as well</li>
					<li>updated how bandwidth is tracked and overseen</li>
					<li>all requests now consume bandwidth</li>
					<li>fewer requests are actually constrained by bandwidth--at the moment, it is only update files and file/thumbnail downloads, as these represent the overwhelming majority of bandwidth consumption and are not at all critical to service operation--this may change in the future, but it suits our purposes for now</li>
					<li>bandwidth tracking code is more sane across the board</li>
					<li>the server's administration service now tracks server-wide bandwidth as it happens</li>
					<li>service and server-wide bandwidth rules are consulted as soon as the request begins</li>
					<li>improved some server response rendering</li>
					<li>permissions are more flexible and content-specific</li>
					<li>improved how file repositories check and process file requests</li>
					<li>created a gui control for managing bandwidth rules</li>
					<li>updated the serverside service object</li>
					<li>the serverside service object now contains bandwidth rules and tracking</li>
					<li>updated how the server deals with services on a db level</li>
					<li>refactored and cleaned a ton of server db code</li>

					<li>the account object now contains a bandwidth tracker</li>
					<li>updated how the server deals with accounts on a db level</li>
					<li>updated the clientside server object</li>
					<li>the clientside server object now contains bandwidth rules and a tracker and has improved error management, recovery, and reporting</li>
					<li>updated how the client deals with services on a db level</li>
					<li>improved how serverside bandwidth errors are caught</li>
					<li>all clientside services start with a 50MB/day bandwidth limit</li>
					<li>existing repositories will get a 250MB/month, 50MB/day default bandwidth limit, just to help us get over the hump--see the release post for info on how to get all the updates anyway</li>
					<li>updated manage services dialog extensively</li>
					<li>service account registration now occurs through a simple button on the normal clientside service edit panel</li>
					<li>all services can now be renamed</li>
					<li>updated the content processing pipeline</li>
					<li>prepared code for future merging of file and tag repositories</li>
					<li>added future support for pend-petitions for files and mappings and simple creation permissions for tag siblings and parents</li>
					<li>the clientside content processing pipeline now operates inside a single database transaction, reducing a great deal of previously redundant hard drive activity</li>
					<li>the serverside content processing pipeline now creates per-service timestamped content definitions</li>
					<li>the clientside content processing pipeline now maintains and appropriately consults a cache for server definitions</li>
					<li>pre-process disk cache is more intelligent</li>
					<li>updated review services to match the new service objects</li>
					<li>service review panels now show more information about error state and so on</li>
					<li>service review panels should now update as soon as services change</li>

					<li>'*' searches will now return no autocomplete results, rather than trying to load absolutely everything</li>
					<li>made wildcard searching significantly more permissable--it now implicitly applies a '*' to the beginning as well as the end of your search input</li>
					<li>the main gui's notebook pages will now be disabled while a session loads</li>
					<li>might have fixed a first-boot layout issue--otherwise added a layout entry to the debug menu for further testing of this problem</li>

					<li>updated sqlite for windows--should be a decent bit faster</li>
					<li>deleted a lot of old code that'll never be needed again</li>
					<li>misc refactoring</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 242</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>optimised 'exact match' similar file queries to run a lot faster</li>
					<li>optimised similar file queries in general, particularly for larger cycle queries</li>
					<li>optimised hamming distance calculation, decreasing time by roughly 45%!</li>
					<li>the similar files tree maintenance idle job will not trigger while there are phashes still to regenerate (this was redundantly and annoyingly blatting the new dupes page as soon as phash regen was paused)</li>
					<li>removed similar files tree maintenance entry from db->maintain menu, as it can be done better from the new dupes page</li>
					<li>adjusted the duplicate search and file phash regen progress gauges to reflect total number of files in cache, not the current batch job</li>
					<li>all maintenance jobs on the duplicates search page will now save their progress (and free up a hanging gui) every 30 seconds</li>
					<li>the duplicates page's cog menu button now lets you put phash regen and tree rebalancing on the normal idle routine, defaulting both to off</li>
					<li>the cog menu can also put duplicate searching on idle time!</li>
					<li>added a very rough 'just show me some pairs!' button to the dupe page--it is pretty neat to finally see what is going on</li>
					<li>I may have reduced the memory use explosion some users are getting during file phash regen maintenance</li>
					<li>wrote an unclose_page action and added it to the shortcuts options panel--it undoes the last page close, if one exists. ctrl+u will be the default for new users, but existing users have to add it under options</li>
					<li>added ascending/descending sort choices for width, height, ratio, and num_pixels</li>
					<li>the client can no longer talk to old http hydrus network servers--everything is now https</li>
					<li>in prep for a later network version update, the client now supports gzipped network strings (which compress json a lot better than the old lz4 compression)</li>
					<li>fixed gif rendering in the Windows build--I forgot to update a build script dll patch for the new version of opencv</li>
					<li>the export file dialog's neighbouring .txt taglist file stuff now allows you to select a specific combination of tag services</li>
					<li>if an hdd import's original file is due to be deleted, any existing neighbouring taglist .txt file will now also be deleted</li>
					<li>the inter-thread messaging system has a new simple way of reporting download progress on an url</li>
					<li>the handful of things that create a downloading popup (like the youtube downloader) now use this new download reporting system</li>
					<li>sankaku seems to be 503-broke due to cloudflare protection--I have paused all existing sankaku subscriptions and removed the sankaku entry for new users (pending a future fix on my or their end)</li>
					<li>I've also removed danbooru for new users for now--someone can fix the long-running sample size file issue in the new downloader engine</li>
					<li>removed unnamespaced tag support from the hentai-foundry parser--maybe someone can try to fix that mess in the new downloader engine</li>
					<li>menubuttons can now handle boolean check menu items that are tied straight into hydrus's options</li>
					<li>menus launched from the newer frame and dialog code will now correctly display their help text on the main gui frame's statusbar! (at least on Windows! Linux and OS X remain borked!)</li>
					<li>fixed a unicode error parsing bug in the gallery downloader</li>
					<li>the server stop (or restart) command now correctly uses https!</li>
					<li>the server test code now works on https as appropriate</li>

					<li>activated branch rebalancing button on the new duplicates page</li>
					<li>activated duplicate search button on the new duplicates page</li>
					<li>search distance on the new duplicates page is now remembered between sessions</li>
					<li>improved the phash algorithm to use median instead of mean--it now gives fewer apparent false positives and negatives, but I think it may also be stricter in general</li>
					<li>the duplicate system now discards phashes for blank, flat colour images (this will be more useful when I reintroduce dupe checking for animations, which often start with a black frame)</li>
					<li>misc phash code cleanup</li>
					<li>all local jpegs and pngs will be scheduled for phash regeneration on update as their current phashes are legacies of several older versions of the algorithm</li>
					<li>debuted a cog menu button on the new duplicates page to refresh the page and reset found potential duplicate pairs--this cog should be making appearances elsewhere to add settings and reduce excess buttons</li>
					<li>improved some search logic that was refreshing too much info on an 'include current/pending tags' button press</li>
					<li>fixed pixiv login--for now!</li>
					<li>system:dimensions now catches an enter key event and passes it to the correct ok button, rather than always num_pixels</li>
					<li>fixed some bad http->https conversion when uploading files to file repo</li>
					<li>folder deletion will try to deal better with read-only nested files</li>
					<li>tag parent uploads will now go one at a time (rather than up to 100 as before) to reduce commit lag</li>
					<li>updated to python 2.7.13 for windows</li>
					<li>updated to OpenCV 3.2 for windows--this new version does not crash with the same files that 3.1 does, so I recommend windows users turn off 'load images with pil' under options->media if they have it set</li>
					<li>I think I improved some unicode error handling</li>
					<li>added LICENSE_PATH and harmonised various instances of default db dir creation to DEFAULT_DB_DIR, both in HydrusConstants</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup and bitmap button cleanup</li>
				</ul>

					<li>added a explicitly unicode popup message to the debug test</li>
					<li>fixed some network error catching code that was using Windows-only error codes</li>

					<li>cleaned import/export folder dialog workflow</li>
					<li>several misc import/export folder improvements</li>
					<li>hydrus servers are now exclusively https with self-signed certificates</li>
					<li>hydrus servers now create server.crt and server.key in their db folders for SSL--these files will be backed up along with everything else on an admin backup command</li>

					<li>fixed file->restart in the built release, including when the install path includes a space</li>

					<li>shutdown repo sync will now report the update summary text and will not spam the intervening statuses to the log</li>
					<li>moved timestamp out of the serviceless media_result and into the locations_manager, to reflect the database's knowledge of each current service having a different timestamp</li>

					<li>improved a very inefficient line of sql in the mappings fetch stage of query result building that was also used in the manage tags dialog. on my dev machine, fetching 256 files' mappings dropped from 2.5s to 9ms!</li>
					<li>regular gallery pages and 'page of images' pages now have a 'paste input' button to mass-add newline-separated queries from the clipboard</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in new txt_tags import folder code</li>
					<li>fixed bad autocomplete predicate sorting</li>
					<li>fixed some sibling autocomplete search_text matching logic</li>
					<li>some byte-based value/range presentation will now correctly convert to bytes, rather than regular decimal numbers</li>
					<li>improved linesep splitting code across the program</li>
					<li>fixed get/setlabel calls across the program to get/setlabeltext, so ampersand characters are handled properly</li>
					<li>wrote an 'all known files' autocomplete cache db and prepped a bunch of code for it--it should be easy to finish next week</li>
					<li>added a new regex practise link to the regex dialogs</li>
					<li>os x app release should display better on retina displays</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 197</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>on client boot, autocomplete caches for specific file/tag service cross-references are now initialised and populated. progress is shown on the splash window</li>
					<li>on client boot, surplus autocomplete caches are deleted</li>
					<li>on service add, new autocomplete caches are created</li>
					<li>on file add/delete, autocomplete caches are updated</li>
					<li>on mappings pend/add/rescind pend/delete, autocomplete caches are updated</li>
					<li>the new autocomplete caches are consulted for all non-'all known tags' queries</li>
					<li>the old autocomplete cache no longer stores counts for specific file services, and the remaining associated maintenance calls are deleted</li>
					<li>databases now start their own mainloops</li>
					<li>databases now wait for their mainloops to finish prepping any large caches before they return to the controller</li>
					<li>the client database waits for autocomplete caches to finish before it finishes its own mainloop</li>
					<li>the padding around flash and the animation bar are included more accurately in some media zoom calculations, which should eliminate some general zoom jankiness and accidental 100% flash zoom coincidences that filled up the whole canvas</li>
					<li>fixed some clientside server boot error spam when local server or booru had no port set</li>
					<li>account refreshes that fail due to a network error will spam less to the log</li>
					<li>fixed .txt unicode tag parsing from import folders, which was not decoding at the correct step</li>
					<li>administrator immediate repository syncs now sync thumbnail downloads if needed</li>
					<li>service thumbnail sync will no longer superfluously check the presence of thumbnails whose files are local</li>
					<li>if a tag entered into the manage tags dialog has a sibling that already exists for all files, then a new 'ignore, as the sibling already exists' choice will appear</li>
					<li>fixed an overcounting bug in 'selection tags' when importing and adding tags at the same time</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in repository sync status text that was overcounting total number of updates by one</li>
					<li>fixed youtube downloader, which broke with the new library on my new dev machine</li>
					<li>the way that tags and predicates are filtered against a tag autocomplete text entry is now much faster</li>
					<li>bumped up the default content update chunk threshold from 100 rows to 5,000, which seems to be speeding up processing significantly, with a cost to recovery latency--see how it works for you</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 196</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed the 8chan thread watcher for boards that host content on media.8ch.net</li>
					<li>improved the thread watcher url check logic so it won't lag with the new fix</li>
					<li>cleaned up the ac generation code a little</li>
					<li>'all known tags' ac counts are now summed from all the known tag services rather than calculated directly (a <= indicator for when these cases overlap will be forthcoming). this speeds up file add/delete, service reset, a/c fetch time, and general tag processing, and reduces the size of the db</li>
					<li>ac generation code now deals with 'is the entry text an exact match or not?' better</li>
					<li>ac generation code will now no longer produce non-exact-match siblings on an exact match search</li>
					<li>ac generation code will no longer save half complete search text into the db as new tags</li>
					<li>on update, the a/c cache and its helper table 'existing tags' will be cleaned of a lot of orphans, which may take a few minutes</li>
					<li>fixed some bad unicode path parsing when importing files in some OSes, I think!</li>
					<li>fixed some bad read autocomplete sibling substitution</li>
					<li>fixed a bug where autocomplete predicate lists would not update if the new list was merely a reorder (which can happen in some unusual sibling cases)</li>
					<li>fixed the tumblr parser for the subtly new API</li>
					<li>import folders now support loading tags from neighbouring .txt files--check the dialog to set up which tag services you would like to import to</li>
					<li>the ipfs file downloader now queries DAG object links, determines if the given multihash is a directory or other complicated object, and if so politely dumps out (handling of directory downloads is forthcoming)</li>
					<li>some db code is cleaned up</li>
					<li>prepared db code for some future subclasses</li>
					<li>wrote most of the new ac cache db</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
					<li>added some browser addon links to the ipfs help</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 195</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>wrote up a v1.0 ipfs help page</li>
					<li>added ipfs services to 'system:file service'</li>
					<li>added a 'multihash prefix' option to ipfs services in 'services->manage services'--it will prefix the given text to multihashes copied to the clipboard (e.g. you could use 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/')</li>
					<li>fixed a bad repo sync processing bug that was incorrectly assuming packages were completely processed when they often were not</li>
					<li>all repos will have their processing timestamps reset on update, forcing a (fast) reprocess of everything they have to cover the previously missed content</li>
					<li>fixed 8chan OP image parsing, which was sometimes failing due to absent md5s in the json</li>
					<li>widened the splash screen a little more so repo sync text can fit a bit better</li>
					<li>a couple of splash status texts are shuffled around</li>
					<li>updated to sqlite 3.11.0 for windows</li>
					<li>if sqlite3 reports at least version 3.11.0, the db will stick to WAL for large transactions (lke vacuum and content processing), since these are fast now</li>
					<li>'namespace:*anything*' will now only appear if the a/c input has no 'subtag' component., e.g. 'character:'</li>
					<li>import and export folders now print simple summaries to the log if they do some work</li>
					<li>tidied up the 'pages' menu</li>
					<li>the various hardcoded 'delete' key events are now also triggered by a backspace on os x</li>
					<li>added a rough 'copy known urls' to the regular thumbnail menu. this is prototype, let me know how you would like this information managed and displayed in future</li>
					<li>in prep for the new cache layer, the autocomplete dropdowns (and hence search domains of all contexts) no longer support 'all known files' cross referenced with 'all known tags'</li>
					<li>misc cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 194</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>ipfs pins and unpins can now be queued up like file repository pending and petitioned, through the regular thumbnail right-click menu, which also reports some/all ipfs pinned selection status</li>
					<li>this ipfs action queue is similarly summarised and commited at the normal service 'pending' menu</li>
					<li>ipfs's 'pinned', 'to pin', and 'to unpin' statuses are displayed on thumbnails with ipfs-specific icons</li>
					<li>you can copy the focussed file's ipfs multihash or all the selected files' ipfs multihashes from the thumbnail menu's share->copy->ipfs multihash</li>
					<li>added a .txt tag parser to the 'path tagging' import dialog--it will parse the same sort of txt files the export dialog produces</li>
					<li>the client's new 'requests' network code is harmonised, generally improved, and now produces hydrus-compatible exceptions</li>
					<li>updated help re the local server and boorus now defaulting to off</li>
					<li>db can now remember service-specific filenames (e.g. ipfs multihashes)</li>
					<li>cleaned up some overly complicated and confused thumbnail menu code</li>
					<li>the pending menu now specifies what it is about to do more plainly</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 193</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>the client's local server and local booru can be turned off from their respective management panels, and from now on, the client will initialise with them this way.</li>
					<li>if the local server or the local booru are not running, their copy/share commands won't appear in right-click menus</li>
					<li>the welcome dialog is now a simpler popup message</li>
					<li>incidence sorted tag lists are now sub-sorted by a-z lexicographic</li>
					<li>pasting many tags that have siblings to the manage tags dialog will ask you if you want to always preference the sibling, saving time</li>
					<li>added a 'clear deleted file records' button to the local file service on the review services window</li>
					<li>idle mode now cannot naturally engage within the first two minutes since client boot</li>
					<li>the autocomplete search logic will not count namespace characters in the autocomplete character threshold, so typing 'character:a' will not typically trigger a (very laggy) full search</li>
					<li>putting a '*' anywhere in an autocomplete search_text will force a full search, ignoring the a/c character threshold</li>
					<li>moved some specific 'give gui time to catch up' pause code to the generalised pause/cancel code that a lot of stuff uses, so big jobs should generally be a bit more polite</li>
					<li>split the daemon class into two--one for big jobs that remains polite, and another for small jobs that triggers regardless of what else is going on. this should increase responsivity for a number of scenarios</li>
					<li>fixed some bad wal failure detection and hence no-wal file creation on some instances of db cursor reinit (usually after service modification). because of now many superfluous no-wal files, existing no-wal files will be deleted on db update</li>
					<li>some external storage location errors are improved</li>
					<li>some internal and external storage location init is improved.</li>
					<li>if an error is detected in the external storage location manager, it will not attempt to rebalance again until the client is rebooted</li>
					<li>improved some upnp error catching</li>
					<li>cleaned up some misc shutdown thread-gui interaction error spam</li>
					<li>did some prep work on a future rewrite of daemon jobs pipeline</li>
					<li>split up some mixed file/data/404 'stuff was missing' exception code</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 192</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>added a 'check on ok' button to the manage subscriptions dialog's subscription panel</li>
					<li>check file integrity now prints missing paths to the log</li>
					<li>fixed a typo that was breaking some repo sync download resumes</li>
					<li>if an external storage location does not exist on client boot, a popup will say so</li>
					<li>resetting a service is now much faster when the service is large</li>
					<li>some repo processing stuff is a bit faster</li>
					<li>improved some image rendering error handling</li>
					<li>some thumbnail errors are recovered from in a better way</li>
					<li>improved db update bit rot resilience</li>
					<li>improved the vacuum disk space error popup with better explanation of the problem and solution</li>
					<li>misc improvements</li>
					<li>moved to win 10 dev machine, so several windows libraries are a bit newer</li>
					<li>updated to opencv 3.1.0 on windows</li>
				</ul>

					<li>added simple ipfs download and import to pages menu</li>
					<li>split confused service data object into a bunch of more flexible and readable subclasses</li>

					<li>raw url downloads now pause and cancel correctly</li>
					<li>optimised some a/c cache clearing in mapping update processing</li>
					<li>optimised content update object -> db yield logistics</li>
					<li>added no-daemons command line switch to disable all daemons</li>
					<li>added no-wal command line switch to disable WAL journalling for the db</li>
					<li>if the db fails to read a new WAL-journalled db file it has just created, it will delete the file and attempt to recreate the db, never trying WAL again</li>
					<li>changed the way the db writes big repo syncs to disk so that the job can be abandoned much more quickly</li>
					<li>improved local file not found error to state the directory or exact path that was the problem</li>
					<li>fixed some socket-level error reporting (I think timeout was part of this)</li>
					<li>the petition approval and denial client-to-server network commit is broken up into smaller steps to reduce server lag and the overall likelihood of timeouts</li>
					<li>subscriptions will no longer add files to their 'successful files' button when the file's url seemed new but it actually was previously deleted</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now identify themselves with an additional popup message when they encounter critical errors during sync</li>
					<li>editing a clientside service will force a reset of the appropriate session cache, so if you change access key, the account changes will be reflected immediately</li>
					<li>the import files dialog will no longer spam error popups on uninteresting or empty files--its 'parsing complete' statement is more verbose instead</li>
					<li>the 1.5s gap between parsing complete and the buttons being enabled is also removed. this was supposed to be helpful, to give you a moment to check the files were as expected, but in the end it was just annoying</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in some thumbnail error catching and regeneration</li>
					<li>improved my network code syncing, so linux and os x releases are cleared out of many old files</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 190</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>fixed some hashing recalculation in collections that meant they reported no files in many cases</li>
					<li>fixed some hashing recalculation when 'remove files' is called</li>
					<li>improved the way the client db stores file information and service->file mappings</li>
					<li>idle processing jobs will now explicitly wake up as soon as the client naturally switches from not idle to idle</li>
					<li>the minimum allowed value for the 'max cpu %' control in the maintenance and processing options panel is now 5%</li>
					<li>the maintenance and processing panel is rewritten and laid out a little clearer</li>

					<li>file storage folder rebalancing will now occur on shutdown maintenance</li>
					<li>the client now closes down more reliably if the db fails to boot</li>
					<li>the client now closes down more reliably if the gui fails to boot</li>
					<li>if a client vacuum fails, it'll now also raise the exact error sqlite gave</li>
					<li>fixed ctrl+a on the autocomplete dropdown (I think the Insert/IME support change broke it)</li>
					<li>the ways the 'read' tag autocomplete control talks to other gui elements is improved</li>
					<li>the tag autocompletes will now refresh their results lists on more internal variable changes</li>
					<li>the query page management controller manages fewer redundant variables</li>
					<li>updated sqlite for windows</li>
					<li>the client and server dbs will attempt to change to TRUNCATE journal mode if WAL causes a read disk i/o error</li>
					<li>misc code cleanup</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 189</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>split the big analyze db calls into individual table/index calls and moved them from update code to the normal maintenance routines</li>
					<li>on vacuum, both the client and server dbs will now bump their page size up to 4096 if they are running on windows (server vacuum is triggered by running a backup)</li>
					<li>vacuum should be a slightly faster operation for both the client and server</li>
					<li>boosted the db cache significantly--we'll see if it makes much difference for things.</li>
					<li>the way the selection tags control updates its taglist on increases to its media cache is massively sped up. An update on a 5,000-thumbnail-strong page now typically works in 3ms instead of ~250ms. large import pages should stream new results much more quickly now</li>
					<li>sped up some slow hash calculation code that was lagging a variety of large operations</li>
					<li>some hash caching responsibility is moved about to make it available for the add_media_results comparison, which now typically works in sub-millisecond time (was about 16ms before)</li>
					<li>some sorted media list index recalculation now works faster</li>
					<li>some internal media object hashing is now cached, so sorted list index regeneration is a bit faster</li>

					<li>backup code for the server now skips re-copying files if they share the same last modified date and file size</li>
					<li>http cannotsendrequest and badstatusline errors will now provoke two reattempts before being raised</li>
					<li>socket error 10013 (no access permission, usually due to a firewall) is caught and a nicer error produced</li>
					<li>socket error 10054 (remote host reset connection) is caught, and the connection is reattempted twice before being raised</li>
					<li>the old giphy API is gone, so I have removed giphy</li>
					<li>forced shutdown due to system exit/logoff is handled better</li>
					<li>pubsub-related shutdown exceptions are now caught and silenced</li>
					<li>an unusual shutdown exception is now caught</li>

					<li>tags that begin with a colon (like ':)' ) will now render correctly in the media canvas background</li>
					<li>some misc code cleanup</li>
					<li>dropped flvlib since ffmpeg parses flv metadata better anyway</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 188</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>if you have custom filters set up, they will now be listed in the normal thumbnail right-click menu, which will expand for them</li>
					<li>'refresh account' button's event no longer waits for service response on the gui thread</li>
					<li>'refresh account' button on review services will now re-enable if the call fails</li>
					<li>added 'hide inbox and archive predicates' checkbox to options->default file system predicates. not sure if this is the best place for it!</li>
					<li>system:hash can now query md5, sha1, and sha256</li>
					<li>existing pages with system:hash will break on update. since this is such a rare predicate, I assume this is not a problem!</li>
					<li>improved db hash cross-reference flexibility</li>
					<li>any pausable popups will now explicitly change their text to 'paused' when they are paused</li>
					<li>upload pending popup now has a title, so it should pause a little more sanely</li>
					<li>regenerate thumbnails popup now has a title, so it should pause a little more sanely</li>
					<li>cleaned up some job pause status logic</li>
					<li>upload pending now works on a stream, so gigantic uploads will cause fewer hitches and overall problems</li>
					<li>upload pending code is cleaned and simplified in several ways, with better error handling and progress reporting</li>
					<li>synctotagarchive is now split into a thousand tiny separate jobs and runs on a separate non-db thread. it will no longer lock the db the whole time</li>
					<li>synctotagarchive popup should be a lot more responsive and will specifically give the gui some time to catch up after every chunk of data processed</li>
					<li>synctotagarchive will update pending tags count (and gui stuff will show the pending tags) as it goes</li>
					<li>synctotagarchive is now a pausable and cancellable operation!</li>
					<li>large repository sync jobs should be a little less laggy on final commit</li>
					<li>system:duration now displays its value as a properly formatted milliseconds time delta, rather than just a big int</li>
					<li>profiles now flush to the log immediately</li>
					<li>some cpu-heavy daemon recheck periods have been extended to reduce potential hangs on slower computers</li>
					<li>some repository sync messaging wording and logic is improved (it should report what it is doing more reliably when you are cpu-busy)</li>
					<li>reordered instances of 'waiting politely', so download text/gauge updates should occur before the wait does</li>
					<li>some misc 'waiting politely' logic is improved</li>
					<li>pixiv ugoira is detected and a better error (that will be ignored by the new sub error throttling code, for instance) is produced</li>
					<li>'uninteresting mime' errors have nicer import status note text</li>

				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 187</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>file->restart now works for linux</li>
					<li>the 'call to' thread pool now has a delayed start, which fixes a shutdown hang in linux (and perhaps the other platforms, in one way or another), when the user hits 'forget it' on the 'already running' boot dialog</li>
					<li>removed some console error junk on abandoned client boot</li>
					<li>if a requested full-size thumbnail is missing, the client will now attempt to regenerate it</li>
					<li>if a requested full-size thumbnail does not render (for instance, during a request to generate a resized thumbnail), the client will now attempt to regenerate it</li>
					<li>some thumbnail fetching and generation logic is slightly improved</li>
					<li>you can now drag animated media around when the inital drag click begins over the animation canvas</li>
					<li>ditched some ultimately unhelpful mouse warping when the cursor was near the edge of the media viewer when a drag began</li>

					<li>import tag options panels will no longer order their tag services randomly</li>
					<li>fixed a bug where import folders would not save changes to their explicit tags</li>
					<li>fixed a bug where under some circumstances, the gallery importer was attempting to display previously deleted files on the screen, causing errors.</li>
					<li>subscriptions will now pause a few seconds after a file import error, which should solve a problem with client hanging when lots and lots of subscription file errors occur one after another</li>
					<li>if subscriptions encounter 5 file import errors, they will pause their sync and try continuing later</li>
					<li>pixiv manga error handling is improved</li>
					<li>bad mime error handling is improved for all importers</li>
					<li>fixed an important bug in the import status cache where error texts were not being stored as unicode, so error texts with non-unicode-compatible characters were causing exceptions when the session was being saved to the db or the import status frame was being loaded</li>
					<li>existing sessions' import status caches should automatically convert their 'notes' to unicode on update</li>
					<li>removed booru db fetch spam when booru download page has no work to do</li>
					<li>fixed a typo in regenerate thumbnails popup message</li>
					<li>fixed some bad event handling for the gallery page's file limit control</li>
					<li>updated some regex defaults to have better multiplatform support and handle a wider array of valid characters</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 186</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Windows release is now 64-bit!</li>

					<li>in the media viewer under Windows, dragging no longer unhides the mouse</li>
					<li>the implicit delay in the downloader-importers is reduced, so redundant files should always stream in a super fast now</li>
					<li>export files dialog will now auto-create missing destination directories</li>
					<li>export files dialog will now work off the gui thread (to stop gui hangups on big jobs) and will report its export status through the export button, which will be disabled until the job is finished</li>
					<li>changed the new tab/shift+tab shortcuts because they break panel control navigation (I want to make these editable soon):</li>
					<li>'fetch autocomplete results now' shortcut is now Ctrl+Space (Raw Control for OS X, not command)</li>
					<li>'IME mode toggle' is now Insert</li>
					<li>cleaned up how control is handled cross-platform--in general, 'control' is always control for windows and linux, and 'control' is command for os x. this may be incorrect.</li>
					<li>json dump errors now report more information about the specific object and its serialisable contents that are causing the problem</li>
					<li>clipped sibling/parent reason entry dialog message when lots of pairs are added</li>
					<li>fixed a bit of bad logic in sibling/parent dialog->content-update workflow</li>

					<li>added some unicode conversion unit tests</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 185</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>right clicking on a tag/predicate in the 'selection tags' box or the 'search' list of active predicates provides new intelligent menu options to discard/require/permit/exclude the selected tags from the current search. try it out!</li>
					<li>this system also works for namespace and wildcard and system predicates</li>
					<li>'predicate a' and its inverse '-predicate a' are no longer considered the same!</li>
					<li>namespace and wildcard predicates will now remove their inverts if they are added to the list of active predicates</li>
					<li>the way inverse predicates are generated and compared is generalised and improved</li>
					<li>fixed 'open a new search page for tag x', which might have been broken?</li>
					<li>quick-entering a tag in the 'read' tag autocomplete entry will now always replace with a sibling if one exists</li>
					<li>quick-entering a tag in the 'write' tag autocomplete entry will now not replace with a sibling--you will get the option of what you want to do</li>
					<li>when this happens, the preferred sibling is labelled on the 'what do you want to do?' popup in the manage tags dialog</li>
					<li>also when this happens, the affected file count for add/pend the preferred sibling should now be correct</li>
					<li>fixed client support for tags that begin with ':', such as many emoticons. these should now be parsed correctly from websites and keyboard input, keep their leading colon through network and db conversions, and display correctly (for the most part!), despite a little bit of magic to make them work</li>
					<li>created a new TimeDelta control to handle finer tuning of optional periods</li>
					<li>improved timedelta->pretty string code to support >60s times</li>
					<li>manage subscriptions dialog now supports day and hour period, with min period of four hours</li>

				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 44</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>All database triggers are removed and replaced with more efficient inline code.</li>
					<li>Cached number of files, namespaces and tags for a tag repo are kept updated, so review services should rarely take very long to load.</li>
					<li>Cached number of A/C counts (current and pending) are kept updated, so A/C results should rarely take very long to load.</li>
					<li>The way A/C cache searches are done is improved.</li>
					<li>The way A/C cache entries are calculated is vastly improved.</li>
					<li>The way several db SELECT DISTINCT * and SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT * ) queries are performed is improved.</li>
					<li>The custom httpconnection object is improved to better deal with server-side connection closes. (Cannot connect to server problem)</li>
					<li>The custom httpconnection object does http redirections more intelligently.</li>
					<li>The custom httpconnection object now parses non-ascii content-type (e.g. utf-8) properly, according to server-side header. The tag pokmon will now parse correctly.</li>
					<li>e621 and rule34@booru.org are fixed. (just a couple parsing-variable changes)</li>

				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 43</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Updated import + booru code</li>
					<li>New booru buttons</li>
					<li>Cut tag parse bug fixed</li>
					<li>Download preview instead of real file bug fixed (I think)</li>
					<li>Fixed the thumbnails not appearing on import bug</li>
					<li>Import flickers less</li>
					<li>Media Classes rewrite is done, although Im not totally happy. Have to think about it.</li>
					<li>A problem with pending tags applying over existing tags no flushing correctly is fixed.</li>
					<li>A/C cache is better, but still a little slow on slow computers.</li>
					<li>system:duration=0 is fixed.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 42</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Autocomplete tag cache DONE. Please tell me if you encounter excessive slowdown or incorrect counts.</li>
					<li>Autocomplete tag logic improved in about five ways. Tags should appear more intuitively and with more accurate counts.</li>
					<li>Copy and paste buttons in manage tag dialog to facilitate spamming many tags from one file to another.</li>
					<li>Imageboard dump is fixed!</li>
					<li>URL download got fixed last week and I forgot to say!</li>
					<li>A peculiar pseudo-foreign-key bug with the active_pending_mappings table is sorted. (leading to more accurate queries and counts)</li>
					<li>Since display of large queries is so much faster, the woah! 12,000 query results warning is gone.</li>
					<li>Fullscreen precache timings are rebalanced, hopefully for the better!</li>
					<li>The importing gui classes are a little smoother, and thumbs should load one by one, not row by row, once the page height is exceeded. The scrollbars should be less janky.</li>
					<li>Page transitions are smoother.</li>
					<li>Importing from URL will now load those urls that are already inside the db (hella fast, too), just like importing from hdd.</li>
					<li>The double-update-download bug is finally fixed! Now youll download update number 258 only once, and not twice in a row. (I hope!) It never mattered much, beyond a little CPU, but it annoyed the hell out of me. Working out what was wrong took ages. (Long story short: Pythons Priority Queues are not parallel FIFOs!)</li>
					<li>There was a weird bug in pending tags sometimes going to higher tag-precedence services, rather than the one chosen in the manage tags dialog.</li>
					<li>There was a typo in reset service.</li>
					<li>More content update unification in the db, making things much neater behind the scenes.</li>
					<li>I found a potential hang in the db-shutdown code.</li>
					<li>I found another potential hang in the db-shutdown code!</li>
					<li>The number of messages in your inbox is now displayed on the statusbar.</li>
					<li>Bold, Italic and Underline now work with Ctrl+B/I/U in the message compose panel.</li>
					<li>The dont receive messages from Anonymous checkbox in Add, Remove and Edit Services for message depots now does something.</li>
					<li>system:unread in message search now has a count.</li>
					<li>A draft will remember its saved changes when you click on another conversation and back again.</li>
					<li>You can now save a draft with zero recipients.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 41</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rich Text Control with Toolbar in messaging.</li>
					<li>Message unread/read status now syncs to message depot.</li>
					<li>Can set defaults for file system predicates.</li>
					<li>Animated Text class written.</li>
					<li>system:unread tag in messaging.</li>
					<li>Import bug fixed.</li>
					<li>Messaging search logic improved.</li>
					<li>Message depot default check time down to 180, and daemon thread improved to manage with that.</li>
					<li>Application startup is more stable.</li>
					<li>Some AddMessage logic improved.</li>
					<li>Drag+Drop service fixed and improved.</li>
					<li>Tags added while importing will now turn up in autocomplete.</li>
					<li>I unified more of the clients content-update db calls. Just making stuff neater.</li>
					<li>I massively simplified the autocomplete tag code in preparation for another bash at doing autocomplete cache. A/C is far too slow atm, imo.</li>
					<li>Some A/C counts are still off, particularly when there are a mix of current and pending. I couldnt figure out what is causing it, but Ill look at it more as I do the cache.</li>
					<li>In add, remove and edit serivces, you can now specify if you want to receive messages from Anonymous or not. Unfortunately, because I forgot to implement it in DoMessageQuery, this checkbox doesnt actually do anything yet! Whoops!</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 40</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Inbox/Archive for messaging works. The inbox icon is back, and F7 to archive as usual.</li>
					<li>Unread/Read for messaging works. Click on your status next to a message panel to change.</li>
					<li>All message participants are shown in the conversation listctrl.</li>
					<li>The message page will open with system:inbox active, ordered by newest message.</li>
					<li>I fixed conversation listctrl sorting in a couple ways.</li>
					<li>Some bugs in the db->gui update reporting system are fixed, so the compose window and draft panel will close properly on a message-send, and the conversation listctrl will swiftly update unread counts and inbox status and so on.</li>
					<li>The draft panels save button wasnt updating sometimes when it should have been.</li>
					<li>html links in messages will show in the main frames statusbar and launch in your browser when clicked.</li>
					<li>I reworked how many system tags are searched in file queries to make them muuuuch faster. Now, any time you go system:hash, :size, :mime, :age, :width, :height, :duration, it (should) be significantly faster than before.</li>
					<li>Ever have a png file that had an ok thumbnail but a black preview/fullscreen? It was probably an LA image, or greyscale with an alpha channel. Display of LA images is now fixed.</li>
					<li>Streamlined the way file archive and delete commands are sent throughout the application, with an eye to eventually adding all other user-commands to the same system (to make it simpler, and also to do undo-redo).</li>
					<li>Ive updated the help docs, including the section on how messaging actually works.</li>
					<li>You can now enter system tags with enter/return from the keyboard, not just double-clicking with the mouse.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 39</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>A whole bunch of stuff I didnt write down that generally made messages work beyond sending Hello World.</li>
					<li>Unicode messages now work.</li>
					<li>Newlines in messages now display properly.</li>
					<li>Fixed contact saving and drag-and-drop to the manage contacts dialog.</li>
					<li>You can now add a contact using a contact address (assuming their service is v39).</li>
					<li>A bug in contact renaming is fixed.</li>
					<li>My contact (hydrus admin) is now added automatically.</li>
					<li>Messages are orphan-deleted properly server-side.</li>
					<li>Message depots you control now get an entry under the admin menu.</li>
					<li>The conversation listctrl is now properly sorted.</li>
					<li>The HtmlWindow that shows message body is now resized to its minimum needed height via magic that I aint gotta explain.</li>
					<li>Messages that fail to send can be retried by clicking on the failed.</li>
					<li>Some draft save/send button enable/disable logic was updated.</li>
					<li>I switched around some server-side account logic.</li>
					<li>You cant zoom a flash window bigger than the screen.</li>
					<li>Ive made the mouse appear in fullscreen when you move it, and this includes while you drag. See how you feel about it. Ill make options to change behaviour if people care.</li>
					<li>Better zip structure. (No more CWD rubbish)</li>
					<li>New tar.gz release with only the code and help. Code is 1.2MB, help is 14MB lol. Ill improve the structure of this release next week. I threw it together by hand today, but Ill improve its structure next week.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 38</h3></li>

					<li>Started an experimental simpler way to send commands to the db, which may open the way for undo-redo.</li>
					<li>Capitalisation option in file->options->gui. It only does the menubar for now, but I will expand it.</li>
					<li>Custom sorts/collects. Under file->options. Check it out, play with it if you care about it.</li>
					<li>Some program initialisation error handling is cleaned up.</li>
					<li>Can now no longer start a server if the admin port it wants to use is occupied. (cant run two servers at once on the same port)</li>
					<li>I broke dump with a typo in a previous release, I think! It is fixed now.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 35</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Slight speedup of review services frame loadtime.</li>
					<li>SVCP now replaced with SCTVCP and CSTVCP for now, with more planned next week.</li>
					<li>Repo sync daemon adds db jobs less manically, now, locking up the gui less.</li>
					<li>Repo sync daemon reports successful updates to the log.</li>
					<li>Tag petition review page has a visual bug fixed.</li>
					<li>ThumbnailMediaPanel manages its underlying bmp canvas more intelligently.</li>
					<li>Some ugly page-closing code was cleaned up.</li>
					<li>There is a regex examples popout window on the regex-filename-tag import dialog, with copy-pastable examples of python regexes thatll work for common filename-parsing situations.</li>
					<li>Home and End keys now select the first/last thumbnail as well as scrolling.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 34</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>DB consolidation, and foreign keys and triggers with it. The db is less prone to orphan ids and miscounts.</li>
					<li>For long-time users, all orphan ids should have all been deleted, reducing weirdness.</li>
					<li>Total size of local service is now tracked accurately.</li>
					<li>Archive while importing should work a bit better now.</li>
					<li>Update logic should be more reliable, as should all service_updates.</li>
					<li>Archive count for file repos should be less wrong.</li>
					<li>Fixed two (!) typos in system:age predicate code.</li>
					<li>File upload is fixed (not sure if it was ever broken in release, but I fixed the stupid thing I did anyway)</li>
					<li>DB (and server) errors should report better now, revealing inner-db code in the traceback. (and printing it to the appropriate log)</li>
					<li>Improved the mime_to_enum object for image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/jpe, image/wtfaretheygoingtocalljpegnow.</li>
					<li>HTTP connections can deal with some esoteric commands, like 301, without throwing a fit. All http goes through the same code.</li>
					<li>Danbooru should now be in your booru list, and it _should_ work.</li>
					<li>Pausing/Cancelling a booru gallery parse should now work.</li>
					<li>4chan dumper now understands captchas being wrong and the thread not existing; in the former case itll let you put in a new captcha and try again, in the latter itll stop the whole dump.</li>
					<li>Some general code neatness improvements.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 33</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Boorus are working for users who started last week</li>
					<li>The server can now manage many more simultaneous requests without bugging out.</li>
					<li>The early freeze/import freeze due to simultaneous access in the client is fixed.</li>
					<li>The clients file+thumbnail server (details in helps advanced.html) works again.</li>
					<li>Client DB now stores md5 and sha1 for all local files.</li>
					<li>Client DB has a larger cache size.</li>
					<li>The freeze caused when importing thousands of files at once with tags is fixed.</li>
					<li>The yaml imageboard import (when you drag and drop a .yaml file onto the imageboards dialog) now adds form fields correctly! If you had problems here, check out install_path/static/default_imageboards.yaml to reset them!</li>
					<li>The autocomplete counts should be more accurate, particularly when there are a mix of current and pending tags in the db.</li>
					<li>The autocomplete in the regex-path dialog will now search the db correctly (it was misconfigured).</li>
					<li>Autocomplete is also just a _little_ faster</li>
					<li>File imports are now low priority, so gui activity should still happen nice and quick even while an import is occurring.</li>
					<li>The review services frame will now show how long until the next update will be checked (see picture above). In case of error, it will show how long until it tries again.</li>
					<li>The review services panel and manage services panel are of a better default size, and they use my new listbook class exclusively, rather than the old notebook.</li>
					<li>Ive added some tooltips on not-obvious widgets.</li>
					<li>Content Updates have vastly improved processing speed on a thumbnail view (x100 in some cases!). Tag updates particularly will not be so slow to process if you have a large search open.</li>
					<li>The import gauge will now show the correct range according to the current queue size, not always the default 100.</li>
					<li>Active Import Pages will throw up a yes/no dialog if you try to close them.</li>
					<li>Some beautifying of code syntax. \n is now os.linesep, which means exported stuff should show up better in notepad.</li>
					<li>Some changes in network protocol, although now I think of them, I realise I forgot to update the network version. They arent important for most users, so w/e.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 32</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>client db serialisation DONE</li>
					<li>Cleaned up a dirty-bmp canvas init issue.</li>
					<li>Resized some dlg stuff that was too tall</li>
					<li>Cleaned up a bunch of unrelated db code</li>
					<li>Tightened the pubsub system so it integrates better with wx.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 31</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>booru prototype</li>
					<li>Fixed some problem with last error timestamp </li>
					<li>Fixed a bug in repo bandwidth tracking</li>
					<li>Fixed URL registration with the client db.</li>
					<li>Made downloading URLs asynchronous again</li>
					<li>Made repo synchronisations not block so much, and not for nearly as long. You should be able to do queries and click on thumbs (albeit at a slower rate) while the client is downloading and processing updates.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 30</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Thumbs are exported, and, along with perceptual hashes, now treated as a global pool, reducing downloads and speeding queries.</li>
					<li>Thumbnail resize is now asynchronous, done as each thumbnail is requested. Changing the thumbnail size in the options dialog happens real quick, and if you dont like a particular size, you can change it back just as fast.</li>
					<li>Temporary DB locking mechanisms ensure serialisation, less inefficient locking.</li>
					<li>ImportPage superclass works a lot better, in a lot less code. DB import code is now even simpler, and much faster, especially for redundant files. The new import page will also tell you how many files were successful/failed/already deleted/already in the db.</li>
					<li>Fetching images for fullscreen or preview is fully asynchronous, and will no longer block the gui thread.</li>
					<li>Some query logic is improved.</li>
					<li>You can now import and export sites/imageboards from the manage imageboards dialog. Itll export to a .yaml file, which is easy to understand with a decent text editor. Just drag and drop onto the dialog to import.</li>
					<li>Selecting thumbs has a little less preview-flicker now.</li>
					<li>The new tagboxes now render numbers prettily, so 4123 -> 4,123.</li>
					<li>(+) namespace:tag now colours properly.</li>
					<li>The background for selected tags is now an appropriate colour.</li>
					<li>You can now choose the colours of any namespace you like in the normal options dialog.</li>
					<li>Clicking in whitespace in the new tagbox deselects, rather than select( 0 )s.</li>
					<li>Spacebar, PageDown, Return and all the other special command characters are now propagated to flash in fullscreen view, just as long as the mouse is over the canvas.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 29</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Big changes to the dbs file storage, as above.</li>
					<li>database->vacuum is reinstated, database->reindex is retired. I recommend you run a vacuum once you are updated; itll only take a minute now.</li>
					<li>Rollback and initialisation bugs are fixed.</li>
					<li>Theres a splash window now that can offer client-boot feedback.</li>
					<li>The way scrolling-to-focus is calculated is improved.</li>
					<li>Pretty much everywhere you see tags will now show coloured tags! I finished up my own tagbox class, which for now will show tags coloured in the default booru scheme. It also loads in a few milliseconds, rather than the ~0.5s of the default listbox. It scrolls faster, too. Ill have user-customisable colours next release.</li>
					<li>Files with invalid resolution, size and mime are now filtered out before dumping to an imageboard.</li>
					<li>A number of misc other bugs were fixed.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 28</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>I fixed the searching immediately bug. It was a stupid typo as usual.</li>
					<li>Post-Filter scrolling should be a bit more reliable.</li>
					<li>Some more log events.</li>
					<li>I did a lot of work on my new tags box, although the actualy gui elements will have to be finished for v29.</li>
					<li>Manage Imageboards wasnt saving properly. It is now.</li>
					<li>My new progressdialog happens in several places. It is a little neater than the one in wx; just better for my purposes.</li>
					<li>I reworked some of the transaction stuff in the db so that I can atomically queue pubsub events. (this means file import are less juddery)</li>
					<li>After becoming very annoyed with wxs listbook/labelbook/whateverbook, I wrote my own. Its all over the place in my dialogs now. It is tighter, more reliable, and can scroll.</li>
					<li>I reworked some of the way sets interacted.</li>
					<li>There was an infinite recursion bug sometimes, when uploading files to a file repo.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 27</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Cleared out some old unused library imports, so the client is slightly smaller.</li>
					<li>Had a cyclical import (!). Luckily, python is forgiving, but I have still fixed it.</li>
					<li>Collection thumbnails will now update with their new pending tags correctly.</li>
					<li>Some wx.Panel vs wx.Window issues and nomenclature resolved.</li>
					<li>Full Page decouple. Now the window to the left is a seperate, much neater class. It and the media/preview windows talk to each other in a clever way that means I can make new kinds of page much faster. It scrolls, too.</li>
					<li>Thumbnails resize will tell the thumbnail window just to redraw itself, not refresh the entire query.</li>
					<li>system:local and system:not local are now mutually exclusive (will swap each other out, rather than overlap), like inbox and archive.</li>
					<li>A little neatening of the system predicate code.</li>
					<li>system:similar_to RMB menu entry fixed for some cases.</li>
					<li>There is a new log window. Go view->new log page to see it. It doesnt show much right now, but you can see synchro successes and errors pop up as they happen.</li>
					<li>There is now a popup button on the import dialog and the URL downloader page that does advanced import options. You can now tell these import processes to archive everything and/or ignore files below a certain size or resolution. By default, the client will not import anything <5KB or <50x50px. You can set no limit.</li>
					<li>Flash windows will now own all keystrokes as long as the mouse cursor is over the flash. If you are browsing/filtering, just move your mouse over or off the flash window to make sure your return/page down/spacebar/escape/whatever is interpreted as you want.</li>
					<li>The URL downloader will not download the same file twice in a row, so you can add a thread URL several times in a row, and itll only download the newest files. The behaviour of this is affected by the exclude deleted files checkbox in the clients options. Ill implement thread watching a bit later.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 26</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The double unnamespaced count bug ( system:blah (70), blah (140) ) in autocomplete should be gone.</li>
					<li>Some rejiggering of how the statusbar updates means active import windows cant spam the statusbar when they dont have focus.</li>
					<li>The count of pending tags is more accurate and uniform. When it says (+3), it means for three files, not in three cases.</li>
					<li>Tag counts overall are better. When it says diaper vore (17), you should be getting 17 files if you enter that search.</li>
					<li>GUI tag repo precedence is slightly more accurate, compared to what the db thinks it should be.</li>
					<li>I nailed down why system:mime wasnt working sometimes, and now it should work all the time.</li>
					<li>I discovered some problems with repo-side bandwidth tracking. I fixed a couple bits, but have notes to look at it more.</li>
					<li>In v25, if system:limit was greater than the search population, it threw an error! Whoops! Fixed now.</li>
					<li>The post-filtering thumbnail problem is totally fixed, as are a couple other instances when thumbs would sometimes not draw.</li>
					<li>The fullscreen change-image-jittering-around problem is fixed, I think.</li>
					<li>Fullscreen archive works again. Not sure why/when it broke.</li>
					<li>Importing with archive checkbox ticked sometimes didnt archive, lol.</li>
					<li>A bunch of decoupling of gui elements, making for much neater code and less gui blocking.</li>
					<li>Decoupling of import from hdd as well.</li>
					<li>Query is now asynchronous! If you do a massive query on a slow computer, you wont lose the gui! You can go check other tabs, whatever, and the query will process in the background, rendering on the page you started it when it is done.</li>
					<li>A number of cpu-heavy numbers are now cleverly cached, so system predicate fetch happens much faster, especially on 100,000+ image dbs.</li>
					<li>Some collect code is sped up and made generally less bonkers.</li>
					<li>I wrote a couple new classes for my most common gui elements.</li>
					<li>There is now an option in file->options to change the number of characters before autocomplete will go search the db for tags! If you have a slow computer and a huge db, you can set it to 2, 3 or even more chars. Default is 1.</li>
					<li>Dialogs that ask you questions will now usually center on their parent window.</li>
					<li>The current selection tagsbox wont show ( blah (12), blah (+3) ), itll combine into blah (12) (+3) (-1). With the + meaning pending and the - meaning petitioned.</li>
					<li>Autocomplete now respects which of the include_current and include_pending buttons are green! Itll only search current/pending as you wish! And the numbers will now be accurate!</li>
					<li>My new question dialog with the yes/no buttons hooks the Escape key to mean no.</li>
					<li>I dont use it much yet, but I have a new message dialog too.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 25</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Thumbnails should load just a bit quicker.</li>
					<li>Made some dict + set code neater</li>
					<li>A new end-of-filtering dialog makes the choices a bit more obvious</li>
					<li>When you exit from fullscreen/filter view, the main thumbnail view it was based on should select (and scroll to!) where you were. But filtering is less reliable, since you may have just deleted the last thing you were looking at!</li>
					<li>Better scrolling in thumbnail view</li>
					<li>Scrolling in thumbnail view will follow the current selection, so the focussed media will always be visible.</li>
					<li>Double right-clicking in filter now deletes instead of keeps (typo)</li>
					<li>Slightly less flickering when processing repo updates</li>
					<li>Made some form code neater</li>
					<li>A lot of the thumbnail gui code has been decoupled and pubsubd. It is all neater behind the scenes, meaning Ill be able to extend it easier in future.</li>
					<li>I completely overhauled how my pubsub works. (pubsub is a messaging system inside the code). It is more flexible and easier for me to work with.</li>
					<li>system:mime was not working in v23, not sure why. Its fixed now.</li>
					<li>Some small speedup + neatening in db queries.</li>
					<li>You can now scroll to the end of a thumbnail page by pressing End. WARNING: If you have like 10,000 thumbs in the current pane, it is going to have to load all those.</li>
					<li>In the AutocompleteTagWrite object, which is the tag entry box in the manage tags dialog, there was a stupid bug that made many requests more expensive. Its fixed.</li>
					<li>Autocomplete now works off one characters input.</li>
					<li>Ive swapped a bunch of expensive objects with easier staticbitmaps for now</li>
					<li>some A/C ordering changes</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 24</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>imageboard dumper prototype</li>
					<li>some db update stuff</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 23</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>A typo was disallowing petition rescinds in certain cases.</li>
					<li>Ive rearranged some of the RMB menu separators to reduce filter/archive misclicks.</li>
					<li>Tag pending upload has more accurate GUI response.</li>
					<li>You can now find similar images from RMB menu.</li>
					<li>Petition approvals are mirrored on an admins client.</li>
					<li>The gui now accepts that admins can overrule deleted content.</li>
					<li>Couple tiny URL downloader gui bugs fixed</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 22</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>system:similar_to</li>
					<li>Some backend namespace stuff</li>
					<li>Couple of gui presentation fixes</li>
					<li>I removed the clunky inbox and archive buttons, see how you feel about it.</li>
					<li>I tried to do ultimatelistctrl to have coloured tags (like a *booru), but it was too buggy and slow for the clients purposes, so Ill probably have to write my own control.</li>
					<li>system:mime exists, now. Not many mimes, yet, but have a play with it, see if you like it.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 21</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>On opening the URL downloader, the textbox input focuses.</li>
					<li>The URL downloader has some better update texts. It pauses nicely, etc</li>
					<li>The URL downloader now orders urls in the order they are parsed. I forgot I was throwing the links in a set, losing all order!</li>
					<li>You wont see dupes in the URL downloaders mediaresultswindow.</li>
					<li>Accounts should now correctly refresh on version update.</li>
					<li>When accounts fail to sync, it dumps the error in the log.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 20</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The preview pane should be a little less schizophrenic.</li>
					<li>Some code cleaning up behind the scenes.</li>
					<li>Thumbnail download optimisation if they already exist locally.</li>
					<li>Icons will show/hide in fullscreen with mouse movement, just like 21/123.</li>
					<li>Weird archiving bug on import is fixed. It was display only.</li>
					<li>Manage tags dialog now works in fullscreen, lol.</li>
					<li>system:not_uploaded_to: now works</li>
					<li>services->review services now loads muuuuuch faster (after the first time)</li>
					<li>There was a typo in setting up initial servers accounts. Email me if you cant make new admins.</li>
					<li>Importing is more streamlined, with more shared code.</li>
					<li>Importing with tags dialog happens more naturally in the import process. You can now do it from drag and drop imports!</li>
					<li>I reordered the default collection dropdown. Your default may be changed, so check your options.</li>
					<li>You can now fetch an account by a deleted file (hash).</li>
					<li>Thumbnails tags now obey tag precedence for deleted stuff. I hope.</li>
					<li>Modify Account Dialog now does its stuff.</li>
					<li>Collections thumbnails now show how many files are in the collection, just next to the icon.</li>
					<li>Ive added to and edited the help extensively, replacing screenshots and updating the text.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 19</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>drop librarium nomenclature</li>
					<li>More intelligent prefetch in fullscreen - things should load muuuuuch faster</li>
					<li>A little more intelligent sum() calcs in autocomplete - non-namespaced tags now sum all their namespaced versions as well</li>
					<li>More rigorous client db transactions, just to make things more pretty and reliable.</li>
					<li>Moved db files to /db, logs to /logs</li>
					<li>Made inroads to getting review services to load faster, but version 20 will have more here.</li>
					<li>Ive updated the frame view so the file info is draw on top of the image. Its a hack for now, inside the image-frame, but it is the only solution for wxs annoying no overlapping policy.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 18</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Some misc gui image info bugs fixed</li>
					<li>Review services dialog is less pubsub buggy</li>
					<li>Fullscreen image prefetch does more and hopefully more intelligently</li>
					<li>Entering a blank tag to quit tag dialog was broke when I updated autocomplete textctrls. Ive fixed it.</li>
					<li>Petition page is fixed, so I can finally clear out the tag petitions!</li>
					<li>F10 was broke when the lib had deleted files lol! Fixed it.</li>
					<li>Review services is more responsive to repo permissions updates.</li>
					<li>Flash files are now correctly put in the inbox on import.</li>
					<li>Synchronise Repositories daemon no longer takes ten gui-blocking seconds to process every update! This was an annoying slowdown, but I figured out what it was and reduced it to <1s with a quick patch. The problem will return with private tag repos, but Ill deal with that when I come to it.</li>
					<li>Synchronise Accounts daemon has some better pubsub so it fires more intelligently. This in turn affects several other daemons, which should all be more responsive; e.g. when your permissions change, your pending thumbs/files should start downloading.</li>
					<li>Improved delete orphans logic for the fiftieth time! It is great now, and wont ever bug you in the gui; it runs invisibly on shutdown and usually only takes a few secs to do its job.</li>
					<li>Some of the gui updates triggered by the daemons are optimised so they block the gui less. Multiple stuff is bundled into single updates, those updates are less buggy, and the gui catches them better. Resetting the public tag repo will no longer lock up a slow system.</li>
					<li>A few versions ago I changed the way repos were registered with the gui, and Ive fixed some of the resultant daemon-related errors. This mostly affects admins, which mostly means me!</li>
					<li>Download Thumbnails daemon was getting pretty slow for large dbs (100k+ files) because of an inefficient db query. This has been cleared up.</li>
					<li>I banged my head against the wall for a couple of hours getting nested notebooks to work, and I am now a better person for it. Review and Manage Services dialogs feature better panel management as a result. Their panels are also much richer, reporting loads more data about the respective service. You can now see how many mappings the public tag repo has without having to delve into sqlite db browser.</li>
					<li>I have unified panel and frame background colouring away from wxs bonkers idea of what things should be coloured. It should mean that everything is properly grey, but please tell me if your gui turns all black or transparent or whatever.</li>
					<li>21457 is now 21,457 in pretty much all cases where it is appropriate.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug with wx gauges not liking large ranges because of signed short or whatever underlying var the C code was using to store it. (That should have been done at the wx-python level, but whatever.)</li>
					<li>localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1 when editing a service, mainly because windows freaks out at the former, deciding to take a couple seconds longer to make any raw connection.</li>
					<li>Dialogs and frames have better, multi-monitor-friendly positioning.</li>
					<li>Flash files are loaded from a temp folder beneath the install dir, rather than libs server, for various reasons. This temp dir also manages file copy/paste operations. I may move this back to the OSs approved temp folder, but well see.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 17</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Tag negation -tag works again</li>
					<li>You can now cancel a filter on the first image</li>
					<li>Some weird filenames that were breaking the new import page no longer do</li>
					<li>Autocomplete (either when searching for tags or adding new ones in) will now show the number of files tagged with that tag after the tag e.g. here</li>
					<li>Manage tag dialog now pops up slightly to the upper left, rather than the center (default) of the screen, so you can see what you are tagging. I may make this more intelligent in future, so it remembers where you last left it.</li>
					<li>I changed a couple small things in help regarding the new import.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 16</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Numtags system predicate now takes into account which of current/pending tags buttons you have active.</li>
					<li>Thumbnail downloads fire more reliably.</li>
					<li>Downloading a file was causing funky thumbnail draw, which seems to be fixed.</li>
					<li>Delete Orphans daemon only fires on application close now, so post-filter db lag is gone.</li>
					<li>Daemons now use events, not conditions! lololol, Im an idiot who cant scroll down a library doc. For the longest time I was like I wish threading had events! and it does.</li>
					<li>Some account checks were missing in tag upload, but are now there.</li>
					<li>A gigantic db rewrite that altered pretty much every table and query.</li>
					<li>Calculation of tags for current selection now support collections, and is fast.</li>
					<li>Was deleting a repo broke in 15? If it was, sorry! Didnt catch it, but its fixed with the new system now.</li>
					<li>Pubsub can do more, and is a little less argh, I think it works like that, and more OOP</li>
					<li>The way tags are held by a thumb can support multiple tag servers (but only does public tag repo for now)</li>
					<li>Repos are now a subclass of service. Ill do more on this in the next version, including some nomenclature changes in the gui.</li>
					<li>Imports are now asynchronous! Theres a new import page thatll open on any import. Its a little jittery, but it all works. If you import 3000 tiny files, your gui may lock up for a few secs since itll be able to import faster than it updates the gui.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 15</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>manage tags dialog focus bug hotfix</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 14</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Selections tags box now shows collections singletons tags</li>
					<li>Autocomplete now sources from the current thumbnails whenever it can (faster than db), and does so intelligently</li>
					<li>Couple of small display bugs fixed</li>
					<li>Some delete logic approved</li>
					<li>Repos do some more efficient inserts on POST content</li>
					<li>Petition optimisation, for auto-soft-approval before update gen</li>
					<li>Dialog parents, dialog parents everywhere</li>
					<li>DB cleanup of a couple of old methods</li>
					<li>Autocomplete Write (when adding tags in manage tags dialog) now sources from the entire networks tags (not just for the files on your hard drive) when you type enough letters to stump it. i.e. If you have no files tagged evangelion, but you do have a file tagged eve, itll show eve if you type ev, but if you type eva, itll requery the db more widely, and give you evangelion.</li>
					<li>system:ratio for searching for wallpapers or whatever. Combine with system:width>x for extra utility!</li>
					<li>You can now hit F3 (manage tags) in fullscreen, whether browsing or filtering.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 13</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>a couple of cpu-intensive DAEMONS schedule themselves better. (less slowdown after a big filter)</li>
					<li>image rendering prefetch improved</li>
					<li>smoother image rendering to screen (especially when zooming), less flickering</li>
					<li>petition approval has smoother, less buggy workflow</li>
					<li>new hashes and tags are added to the db muuuuuuuuch more efficiently. most public tag repo updates happen in a second or two, rather than 30+</li>
					<li>some of the internal commands are streamlined together into a single class</li>
					<li>ctrl-s fixed</li>
					<li>clear pending file repos pubsub fixed</li>
					<li>ctrl-r now shows/hides splitters</li>
					<li>thumbnail delete logic is better</li>
					<li>select logic is better</li>
					<li>deleted_remote_files bug fixed</li>
					<li>headache-inducing weakref repositories __eq__ bug in pubsub fixed</li>
					<li>with keyword all over the place now. turns out wx has a bunch of objects with support it (including dialogs!)</li>
					<li>gridsizers are now all flexgridsizers</li>
					<li>the list of tags on the current selection now has a weight attached like flower (23) to show how many of the current selection have that tag. it doesnt support collections weight yet.</li>
					<li>revised some ambiguous repo error messages</li>
					<li>you can now have a main window with no pages open</li>
					<li>right click menus on a selection are vastly improved (lots more info), but still a way to go.</li>
					<li>on the import files dialog, you can now specify to auto-archive rather than send to inbox</li>
					<li>thumbnails now know where they are uploaded/pending/petitioned to and will show that info with different icons</li>
					<li>escape key now deselects</li>
					<li>manage repos dialog is completely revised. comments appreciated.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 12</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>You can now tell lib to search current tags only, pending tags only, or both.</li>
					<li>Tag search is more efficient.</li>
					<li>Search in general is more efficient.</li>
					<li>Search code is more beautiful and decoupled.</li>
					<li>Tags are stored in memory more beautifully, and a similar class holds repositories for thumbs also.</li>
					<li>Age predicate is fixed (twice!)</li>
					<li>Server code is more beautiful. DB-Server interface is decoupled into a mixin class to make it easier to understand and manage.</li>
					<li>Icons for pending and petitioned files, and for currently downloading.</li>
					<li>Prefetch fixed, so nearby fullscreen images load just in case you want to see them.</li>
					<li>Fixed a redundant pending tags bug</li>
					<li>Fixed a swf tag petitions bug</li>
					<li>On boot, temp folder is cleared.</li>
					<li>The current tags window is now union on the current selection, not intersect. If nothing is selected, it shows all the tags of the current selection. In a later version, Ill order this list by count-weight.</li>
					<li>All (I think) tag updates are synchronous-ish with the gui. As updates come in from the public repo, thumbs will update themselves appropriately. Same goes for repositories.</li>
					<li>Gui-code tidy-up</li>
					<li>On deleting a local file, preview clears.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 11</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>swf support, lol</li>
					<li>You can now backup repositories from the admin menu. Info in help.</li>
					<li>Under the help menu, a quick way to set up the beta repositories credentials.</li>
					<li>Account sync was full of bugs, and is now less so.</li>
					<li>When you go fullscreen, the preview window should go blank, which should save a little cpu time when you are looking at gifs and your ears when you are looking at swfs.</li>
					<li>Auto-complete is muuuuuch faster than it was. Also more correct. Still more work to do, though.</li>
					<li>Librarium hosts an http server on 45874, which supports GET /file and /thumbnail just like a file repo. Utterly prototype, but you can test it right in your browser if you like. Go http://127.0.0.1:45874/file?hash=whatever when lib is running.</li>
					<li>Ctrl-T opens a new local page/tab, Ctrl-W closes the currently active</li>
					<li>Image display in preview and fullscreen has been revamped, and is now both a little buggy and much better.</li>
					<li>Bandwidth tracking both server- and client-side should be more reliable.</li>
					<li>Delete lag (the slowdown after you boot/delete something) should be reduced.</li>
					<li>Query lag is significantly reduced, and new operators for predicates have been added. You can now go  on a bunch of values like size and width and duration to get approximately equal to, which actually means plus or minus about five percent.</li>
					<li>A stupid error on file upload is fixed. If youve been having problems seeing the files you uploaded in preview, try resetting the respective file repository.</li>
					<li>A few daemon bug fixes.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 10</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>hotfix for tag updates</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 9</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Pressing a cursor key when no thumb is focussed no longer throws an exception.</li>
					<li>Hitting enter on a blank input in the manage tags dialog now quickly oks the dialog.</li>
					<li>Annoying splitter exception on import is gone. It was a one-line fix, because I was being stupid.</li>
					<li>All searches should be a little faster. Mostly effects searches with 1000+ results.</li>
					<li>Modal dialogs (in particular) should be just a little more responsive now. Less stuff is being dumped on the wx gui thread, and all db handling is more parallel.</li>
					<li>Slow petition approval fixed, made almost instant.</li>
					<li>Image rendering has been revamped. It should be less stuttery now, but there is still more work to do.</li>
					<li>Some pending tag update logic was fixed.</li>
					<li>If the focused thumb goes from not local to local, its preview will load. (its on my to-do to do the opposite: clearing preview on delete in remote search.</li>
					<li>DB daemons rewritten completely, so now a whole bunch of stuff flushes more efficiently, more reliably, and with less gui-blocking. Things happen smoother now.</li>
					<li>Can now create repository database backups via librarium. Sending the command (via the admin menu) tells the repo to lock and copy its .db files to .db.backup. Ill update help to explain this more.</li>
					<li>Can now copy files from within librarium to the clipboard! Just select from the right-click menu or press Ctrl-C, and your selection will be copied to clipboard. You can then paste to any directory, for quick export to anywhere. The export command remains for exporting thousands of files.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 8</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed a missing transaction on repo db update.</li>
					<li>Export path can now be on other hard drives. Youll probably want to keep it on the same drive if you have lib on a usb stick, though.</li>
					<li>Fixed a really stupid &lt; for &gt; typo that was causing a ton of gui blocking and repository slowdown.</li>
					<li>File and thumbnail downloads are much snappier.</li>
					<li>One person had a very odd error while trying to open manage repos. I dont understand what actually caused the traceback to happen, but I think I fixed it nonetheless.</li>
					<li>inbox/archive buttons above the searchbox are now mutually exclusive.</li>
					<li>Fixed the version number in libs about window.</li>
					<li>Fixed the preview window so it remembers its last size properly. Also reduced its min size so you can make it tiny.</li>
					<li>Fixed the problem people were having with admin rights. See this post if you were having problems.</li>
					<li>The RegisterRepoRequest that was filling peoples logs on upload should be fixed now. Turns out I didnt understand how wx.CallAfter works during modal dialogs! I threw in a horrible fix, but it works. Ill revisit it.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 7</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>db changes are done</li>
					<li>fixed a bug with posting tag petitions</li>
					<li>when typing tags in, autocomplete now harvests from pending tags as well as current</li>
					<li>the regex dialogs tag entry is now autocomplete</li>
					<li>leading/following whitespace removal for tags, and multi-whitespace -> single</li>
					<li>a little server-side pubsub neatening up</li>
					<li>when importing via dialog, there is now a checkbox to ignore subdirectories</li>
					<li>Added a quick readme.txt in the base_dir for people who choose to extract rather than install. (Everyone should check out the help at least once)</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 3->6 (never released)</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>after much feedback, completely rewrite db</li>
					<li>general improvements to gui</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>version 2</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>general fixes and improvements</li>
				</ul>

					<li>first true metadata beta</li>
					<li>shit actually works</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>versions 0.91 -> 0.99</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li>move to python and wx, and an application- rather than browser-based model</li>
					<li>building on concepts</li>
					<li>scrapping p2p, turning to client-server</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h3>early versions of beta</h3></li>
				<ul>
