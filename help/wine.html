			<h3 id="intro"><a href="#intro">getting it to work on wine</a></h3>
			<p>Several Linux and macOS users have found success running hydrus with Wine. Here is a post from a Linux dude:</p>
			<i>
			<p>Some things I picked up on after extended use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wine is kinda retarded sometimes, do not try to close the window by pressing the red close button, while in fullscreen.</li>
				<li>It will just "go through" it, and do whatever to whats behind it.</li>
				<li>Flash do work, IF you download the internet explorer version, and install it through wine.</li>
				<li>Hydrus is selfcontained, and portable. That means that one instance of hydrus do not know what another is doing. This is great if you want different installations for different things.</li>
				<li>Some of the input fields behave a little wonky. Though that may just be standard Hydrus behavior.</li>
				<li>Mostly everything else works fine. I was able to connect to the test server and view there. Only thing I need to test is the ability to host a server.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Installation process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0. Get a standard Wine installation.</li>
				<li>1. Download the latest hydrus .zip file.</li>
				<li>2. Unpack it with your chosen zip file opener, in the chosen folder. Do not need to be in the wine folder.</li>
				<li>3. Run it with wine, either though the file manager, or though the terminal.</li>
				<li>4. For Flash support install the IE version through wine.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you get the client running in Wine, please let me know how you get on!</p>
